ebuild KEYWORDS "-*" probably is going to be dropped unless somebody has a damn good arg for it.
effectively, it blocks ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="whatever-arch" emerge some-ebuild
it works cause of the stacked nature of config in stable; can do it in rewrite, but it's ugly and (personally) I don't think it's
properly implemented (use package.mask)
