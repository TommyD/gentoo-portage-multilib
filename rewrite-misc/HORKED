list what's horked, note your name by it if you want dibs.
This ain't complete either.

namespace fixes required, plus potentially a bit of rewrite
portage.sync
portage.transports		# transports needs to be unified behind fetcher design.
								# need a fetchable class also.

not finished-
portage.cache.multiplex # should be a master/slave class, master for querying, both for updates/deletions
portage.restrictions
potage.config.central	# need's to be renamed, and needs new.instancemethod hacks, read intro for explanation.

portage.vdb					# consult harring if you're after this, since this is a helluva lot more complex then just a repo
portage.binpkg				# bind it to portage.ebuild whereever possible

not started
portage.config.domain	# consult intro doc if you attempt it, and collect feedback from jason/brian regarding it please
								# harring will want it one way which probably slightly conflicts with what jason wants (and vice versa),
								# so be aware it's probably going to be a shifting class definition.
								# still need a prototype though.


not started
portage.ebuild.repository.gpgtree
# ebuild repository derivative, bind gpg verification within metadata creation.  including manifest verification (not just signed).
# need a design for having gpg trust mapped into repositories (overkill?  really need multiple trust rings?)

not even a scratched out yet
portage.*.fetchable 		# find a place for this.  simple one however.
portage.*.(merge|build)operation
# no base class defined yet, see intro
