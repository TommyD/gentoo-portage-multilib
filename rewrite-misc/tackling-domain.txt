tag a 'x' in front of stuff that's been implemented

unhandled (eg, figure these out) vars/features
	(user)?sandbox
	userpriv(_fakeroot)?
	digest
	cvs (this option is a hack)
	fixpackages , which probably should be a sync thing (would need to bind the vdb and binpkg repo to it though)
	keep(temp|work), easy to implement, but where to define it?
	PORT_LOGDIR
env overrides of use...

vdb wrapper/vdb repo instantiation (either domain created wrapper, or required in the vdb repo section def)
	CONFIG_PROTECT*
	collision-protect
	no(doc|man|info|clean) (wrapper/mangler)
	suidctl
	nostrip.  in effect, strip defaults to on; wrappers if after occasionally on, occasionally off.
	sfperms

build section (vars)
	C(HOST|TARGET), (LD*|C*)FLAGS?
	(RESUME|FETCH)COMMAND are fetcher things, define it there.
	MAKEOPTS
	PORTAGE_NICENESS (imo)
	TMPDIR ?  or domain it?

gpg is bound to repo, class type specifically.  strict/severe are likely settings of it
the same applies for profiles.

distlocks is a fetcher thing, specifically (probably) class type.

buildpkgs is binpkg + filters.

how to handle packages.provided?  Just return a Null package whenever requested of that repo?  seems hackish
