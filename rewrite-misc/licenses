hokay, just added license support; issue with it's implementation though, there's no negation yet.
currently it's effectively for the filter-
not ( licenses in $ACCEPT_LICENSES || licenses in package.license )
to support negation, needs to be
not ( licenses in package.license || ( licenses in $ACCEPT_LICENSES && not licenses in (filtered) package.license ) )
so... anyone after getting it added (I'll do it when I get around to it), poke in portage.config.domain.domain
