  4 Dec 2002; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> sandbox.h sandbox_futils.c :
  sandbox_futils defined a dirname() function that was masking the same
  function in glibc and was broken (e.g.: SANDBOX_DIR was being set to
  '/usr/lib/portage/bi/').  Fixed function to return expected results and
  renamed it to sb_dirname() to no longer mask the glibc function.  Closes bug
  11231.

  4 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix a segfault in libsandbox.c if canonicalize() was called with
  first parameter = NULL.

  1 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix my braindead 'return 1;' in a void function.  Updated sandbox.c,
  cleanup() for this.

  Change cleanup() in sandbox.c not to exit with fail status if
  the pidsfile is missing.  We really should still display sandbox
  violations if they occured.

  31 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Update cleanup() in sandbox.c to remove the PIDSFILE if this is
  the last sandbox running.

  25 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Major cleanups to mainly libsandbox.c again.

  22 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Add copyrights to sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.h.  If wrong, the
  parties involved should please contact me so that we can fix it.

  Add opendir wrapper to libsandbox.c.

  21 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Do some more cleanups to ecanonicalize(), as it dropped filenames in
  rare cases (after my symlink cleanups), and caused glibc to bork.
  These fixes went into canonicalize.c.

  20 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix spawn_shell() and main() in sandbox.c to properly return fail
  status.

  19 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  The new canonicalize() function in libsandbox.c also resolved symlinks,
  which caused on cleaning sandbox errors if the symlink pointed to a
  file in the live root.   Ripped out canonicalize() and realpath() from
  glibc; removed the symlink stuff, and changed them to ecanonicalize()
  and erealpath().

  18 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Ripped out all the wrappers, and implemented those of InstallWatch.
  Losts of cleanups and bugfixes.  Implement a execve that forces
  $LIBSANDBOX in $LD_PRELOAD.  We can now thus do away with the feared
  /etc/ld.so.preload (*g*) ... Made the needed changes to sandbox.c,
  sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c.  Rewrote the Makefile for most
  parts; it now have an install target.
  
  Reformat the whole thing to look somewhat like the reworked sandbox.c
  and new sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c from:
  
    Brad House <brad@mainstreetsoftworks.com>.
