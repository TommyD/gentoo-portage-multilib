  22 Jun 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> libsandbox.c, canonicalize.c
  create-localdecls :
  When checking path names of files accessed, we need to canonicalize it, else
  it may be a symlink in a 'write allowed' directory pointing to a file in a
  directory we should not have write access to.

  With something like coreutils-5.0, we have two problems:
  1)  One of the tests checks if getcwd() can return a path longer than
      PATH_MAX.  This test then tries to create a dir which even while
      created local (mkdir("conftest2")), it ends up being resolved with
      a name that is much larger than PATH_MAX.  The problem now is that
      canonicalize() have undefined behaviour when the path was too long
      (returned wrongly truncated paths, etc), and pass the wrong path to
      before_syscall() (causing the bogus sandbox violations).
  2)  The ecanonicalize() function we used, along with the canonicalize()
      function did not support longer than PATH_MAX.  This is partly a
      cause for 1), but the error checking (rather lack of it) of calls
      to erealpath() in canonicalize() was the prime reason for 1).

  As we do not use this canonicalized name to call the function, we resolve this
  by fixing canonicalize() to do better error checking, and ecanonicalize() as
  well as all functions in libsandbox.c to use a PATH_MAX of 'PATH_MAX * 2'.
  While they will resolve paths properly now, and can check if a write/read is
  allowed, the functions called from the sandboxed environment will still work
  as expected.

  This should resolve bug #21766.

  06 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> libsandbox.c :
  For some reason sandbox fails with a 'open_wr' if you run 'locale -a' under
  it (bug #16298).
  
  Problem is that for some reason locale fopen's locale.alias with mode "rm".

  -------------------------------------------------------
  nosferatu root # grep fopen locale.log 
  fopen("/usr/share/locale/locale.alias", "rm"ACCESS DENIED  open_wr:   /usr/share/locale/locale.alias
  nosferatu root # 
  --------------------------------------------------------

  I checked the source of locale, but it have fopen with mode 'r', so
  not sure where the "rm" mode comes from.  Anyhow, changed the check in
  before_syscall_open_char() to also see mode "rm" as readonly.

  23 Feb 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> create-localdecls :

  Add glibc-2.3 support.

  22 Feb 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> sandbox.c :

  Some /etc/ld.so.preload fixes.  Just changed the #if defines to cover all
  operations releated to preload, as well as only try to modify ld.so.preload
  if we can.  Also modify to write the pid to /tmp/sandboxpids.tmp even when
  not using ld.so.preload.  Fix to not write this instance of sandbox's pid
  to /tmp/sandboxpids.tmp on exit if this is not the last sandbox running.

  22 Feb 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> Makefile :
  
  Changed the LD to CC for hppa.

  22 Feb 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> create-localdecls :
  
  Killed the previous changes I made.

  17 Feb 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> create-localdecls :
  
  Added parisc to BROKEN_RTLD_ARCHLIST to see if it we can fix the relocation probs.

  09 Jan 2003; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> sandbox.c :
  
  Don't segfault if $HOME isn't set, set $HOME to "/" instead.  Fixes bug 10868.

  16 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> create-localdecls :

  Fix memory leak for mips, bug #12236.  Thanks to Torgeir Hansen <torgeir@trenger.ro>
  for this fix.

  4 Dec 2002; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> sandbox.h sandbox_futils.c :
  
  sandbox_futils defined a dirname() function that was masking the same
  function in glibc and was broken (e.g.: SANDBOX_DIR was being set to
  '/usr/lib/portage/bi/').  Fixed function to return expected results and
  renamed it to sb_dirname() to no longer mask the glibc function.  Closes bug
  11231.

  4 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix a segfault in libsandbox.c if canonicalize() was called with
  first parameter = NULL.

  1 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix my braindead 'return 1;' in a void function.  Updated sandbox.c,
  cleanup() for this.

  Change cleanup() in sandbox.c not to exit with fail status if
  the pidsfile is missing.  We really should still display sandbox
  violations if they occured.

  31 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Update cleanup() in sandbox.c to remove the PIDSFILE if this is
  the last sandbox running.

  25 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Major cleanups to mainly libsandbox.c again.

  22 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Add copyrights to sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.h.  If wrong, the
  parties involved should please contact me so that we can fix it.

  Add opendir wrapper to libsandbox.c.

  21 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Do some more cleanups to ecanonicalize(), as it dropped filenames in
  rare cases (after my symlink cleanups), and caused glibc to bork.
  These fixes went into canonicalize.c.

  20 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix spawn_shell() and main() in sandbox.c to properly return fail
  status.

  19 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  The new canonicalize() function in libsandbox.c also resolved symlinks,
  which caused on cleaning sandbox errors if the symlink pointed to a
  file in the live root.   Ripped out canonicalize() and realpath() from
  glibc; removed the symlink stuff, and changed them to ecanonicalize()
  and erealpath().

  18 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Ripped out all the wrappers, and implemented those of InstallWatch.
  Losts of cleanups and bugfixes.  Implement a execve that forces
  $LIBSANDBOX in $LD_PRELOAD.  We can now thus do away with the feared
  /etc/ld.so.preload (*g*) ... Made the needed changes to sandbox.c,
  sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c.  Rewrote the Makefile for most
  parts; it now have an install target.
  
  Reformat the whole thing to look somewhat like the reworked sandbox.c
  and new sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c from:
  
    Brad House <brad@mainstreetsoftworks.com>.
