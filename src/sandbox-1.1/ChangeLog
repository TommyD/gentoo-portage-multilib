  22 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Add copyrights to sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.h.  If wrong, the
  parties involved should please contact me so that we can fix it.

  Add opendir wrapper to libsandbox.c.

  21 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Do some more cleanups to ecanonicalize(), as it dropped filenames in
  rare cases (after my symlink cleanups), and caused glibc to bork.
  These fixes went into canonicalize.c.

  20 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix spawn_shell() and main() in sandbox.c to properly return fail
  status.

  19 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  The new canonicalize() function in libsandbox.c also resolved symlinks,
  which caused on cleaning sandbox errors if the symlink pointed to a
  file in the live root.   Ripped out canonicalize() and realpath() from
  glibc; removed the symlink stuff, and changed them to ecanonicalize()
  and erealpath().

  18 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Ripped out all the wrappers, and implemented those of InstallWatch.
  Losts of cleanups and bugfixes.  Implement a execve that forces
  $LIBSANDBOX in $LD_PRELOAD.  We can now thus do away with the feared
  /etc/ld.so.preload (*g*) ... Made the needed changes to sandbox.c,
  sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c.  Rewrote the Makefile for most
  parts; it now have an install target.
  
  Reformat the whole thing to look somewhat like the reworked sandbox.c
  and new sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c from:
  
    Brad House <brad@mainstreetsoftworks.com>.

  Additional Copyrights now due to the InstallWatch code:
