  20 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Fix spawn_shell() and main() in sandbox.c to properly return fail
  status.

  19 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  The new canonicalize() function in libsandbox.c also resolved symlinks,
  which caused on cleaning sandbox errors if the symlink pointed to a
  file in the live root.   Ripped out canonicalize() and realpath() from
  glibc; removed the symlink stuff, and changed them to ecanonicalize()
  and erealpath().

  18 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Ripped out all the wrappers, and implemented those of InstallWatch.
  Losts of cleanups and bugfixes.  Implement a execve that forces
  $LIBSANDBOX in $LD_PRELOAD.  We can now thus do away with the feared
  /etc/ld.so.preload (*g*) ... Made the needed changes to sandbox.c,
  sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c.  Rewrote the Makefile for most
  parts; it now have an install target.
  
  Reformat the whole thing to look somewhat like the reworked sandbox.c
  and new sandbox.h and sandbox_futils.c from:
  
    Brad House <brad@mainstreetsoftworks.com>.
