# Copyright 2002 Gentoo Technologies, Inc.; Distributed under the GPL

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> output.py :
  bugfix, write read() function instead of red(), doh !
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py :
  implemented the ! dependency which prevents incompatible packages to be
  installed on the same system at the same time

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  most emerge invocation options now have alternative short flags
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  emerge now doesn't unmerge the last version of an installed version by
  default anymore, to really remove all instanced of packages the --all flag
  has to be used, the --safe flag is deprecated
  
  3 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> output.py, emerge,make.globals :
  all output can now be turned to black and white by using the functions in 
  output.py, this determines the mode by checking to NOCOLOR variable in
  make.conf or make.globals

  3 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  made it possible to run emerge --help and --search as non root

*portage 1.8.8-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py, ebuild.sh, ebuild.5 :
  added support for a pkg_setup() function which is executed before anything
  else and can be typically used for package configuration actions or required
  system checks

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  implemented the noauto MAINTAINER flags for all relevant ebuild commands

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  make env-update disregard backup files
  
  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added --pretend support instead of interactively asking to proceed,
  also added a delay before unmerging though to be sure

*portage 1.8.8 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added --safe switch to complement the --unmerge option

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  rewrote the packagename without category support to also graceously handle
  deps specifiers at the beginning, this shouldn't be used in the ebuilds, but
  are very handy when using emerge --unmerge

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added emerge --unmerge support

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  added packagename without category support in the dep_match function

*portage 1.8.7 (30 Jan 2002)

  30 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  integrated and slightly adapted Brent Rahn's code to support package names
  without category

  30 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh :
  integrated and fixed Azarah's patch to fix the wrongly generated archive size
  in the digests

*portage 1.8.6-r3 (28 Jan 2002)

  28 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  disabled warnings about non existant config file paths

  28 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added verwilst pkgsearch code, which was turned into a seperate class and
  refactored for clarity and execution speed

  28 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  renamed _xxx vars to _prepart in Vitaly's code addition

*portage 1.8.6-r2 (27 Jan 2002)

  24 Jan 2002; Vitaly Kushneriuk <vitaly@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  Fixed version compare code Also added test script to test future versions.

*portage 1.8.6-r1 (24 Jan 2002)

  24 Jan 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> dojar:
  Fixed typos.
  
*portage 1.8.6 (23 Jan 2002)

  22 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> libsandbox.c :
  added an additional check for SANDBOX_ON to optimize the speed in the execvp
  function call. Also removed error messages being printed when the PATH var
  isn't set.
  
  20 Jan 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> dojar :
  added dojar shell command as a java JAR handler

  17 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  The package chosen by "emerge sys-apps/shadow" now matches that chosen in an
  emerge update or emerge system.  I forgot to add some "*" dep code to the
  dep_nomatch() method; this is now fixed.

*portage 1.8.5 (13 Jan 2002)

  13 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ebuilds.sh, portage.py:
  added fine grained maintainer settings

*portage 1.8.4 (13 Jan 2002)

  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  "emerge sys-apps/bash/" now works. (trailing "/" stripped to make
  tab-completion users happy)  This fixes bug #119

  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  Portage should no longer bomb out if the current working directory doesn't
  exist (has been deleted from underneath).
  
  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  added "--world" option for "emerge update".   This tells Portage to update
  the base system *as well as* upgrade any packages that are currently
  installed but have new versions available.  This is your standard full system
  update command.  This fixes bug #122

  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  Added an expandpath() cache which speeds up merging dramatically.

*portage 1.8.3 (11 Jan 2002)

  11 Jan 2002; Mikael Hallendal <hallski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  added functions econf and einstall. Also made src_compile having a default
  implementation.

*portage 1.8.2 (07 Jan 2002)

  07 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> :
  sandbox included in portage
	
*portage 1.8.1 (30 Dec 2001)

  29 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  "emerge update" is now functional!  Although the algorithm really should be
  sound, it is still considered in testing since we may need to tweak some
  dependencies.

  27 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  Removed objprelink from the default USE variable.

*portage 1.8.0 (22 Dec 2001)

  22 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  I messed up the "transparent .so library" update.  Included is the correct
  fix, which seems to allow glibc to update on my system without any tricks.
  I just merged a new glibc while in X, without using any of glibc's old
  pkg_postinst/pkg_preinst hacks.
  
  21 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.defaults.5, make.conf.5 :
  Moved make.defaults.5 to make.conf.5 and updated contents.

*portage 1.7.8 (21 Dec 2001)

  21 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  ebuild install doesn't throw away the compile directory if ebuild has been
  changed and MAINTAINER is set; we now use mv -f to move files into location
  on the filesystem, making our library install method even more robust. It
  should now be totally safe to  upgrade glibc while in X and playing music
  with xmms and surfing the Web and compiling 20 applications at once :)

* portage 1.7.7 (14 Dec 2001)

  14 Dec 2001; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>: portage.py :
  movefile() now unlink()s the destination file first which solves shared
  library install problems.

* portage 1.7.6 (13 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  env_update() now generates an /etc/csh.env file in csh shell format.

* portage 1.7.5 (13 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  added a little fix so a ~ dep isn't satisfied by a *much* later installed
  version; i.e. ~media-libs/freetype-1.3.1 satisfied by
  media-libs/freetype-2.0.5 being installed.
  
  30 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild :
  added a KeyboardInterrupt handler so ^C'ing a running ebuild process doesn't
  produce a Python traceback.

* portage 1.7.4 (29 Nov 2001)

  29 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  removed an unnecessary quirk in the code preventing virtual packages from
  being in any other category but "virtual".
  
  25 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge :
  info file detection code has been improved.  

* portage 1.7.3 (20 Nov 2001)

  20 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> pdb, pdb.cgi, xpak :
  used /usr/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/spython.  Fixed.

* portage 1.7.2 (13 Nov 2001)

  13 Nov 2001; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> :
  emake will now try to build in parallel, and if it fails, will retry in
  non-parallel mode.
  
  13 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh :
  an ebuild that used an archive with a name that was part of another archive
  would cause Portage to mess up the digest check.  No longer.

  31 Oct 2001; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> make.conf, make.globals :
  comments about merging the fetch programs before trying to use them.

* portage 1.7.1 (30 Oct 2001)

  30 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  I accidentally broke "=" deps by being sloppy when I added "*" deps.  Trivial
  fix applied.

* portage 1.7 (29 Oct 2001)

  29 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  strange typo fix in the empty() digraph method.

* portage 1.6.12 (29 Oct 2001)

  29 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  "*" deps now implemented. "=sys/foo-1*" matches the latest 1.x version/rev of
  sys/foo, but will not match a 2.x version.

  26 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  various new categories added.

Portage 1.6.11, released 18 Oct 2001
====================================

	*portage.py; device nodes are now not unmerged at all.


Portage 1.6.10, released 18 Oct 2001 
===================================

	*ebuild.sh: A and AA fix; now any A="foo" lines in the ebuild are ignored,
	allowing ebuilds with them to continue working.
	
	*portage.py: remove gnome-apps, gnome-office, gnome-libs, add gnome-extra
	categories.

	*ebuild.sh, portage.py: You can now use USE variables in SRC_URI to
	conditionally include archives.  In MAINTAINER mode, all archives are
	automatically included so that maintainers can check SRC_URIs and also
	generate complete digests.  A new file-based DEPEND and RDEPEND-passing
	mechanism has been added.
	
	*ebuild.sh Now adds filesize to the digest files

Portage 1.6.9, released 15 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	unmerge() now does not touch device nodes.  Unlinking them or touching them
	in any way is bad practice.


Portage 1.6.8, released 12 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	movefile() will now unlink() destfile if it is a symlink.  Should fix 
	problems where file gets created at symlink target rather than replacing
	the symlink.

	*queryhost.sh (agriffis)
	Parallel pinging and other fixes.

Portage 1.6.7, released 05 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	(last-minute fix)
	CONFIG_PROTECT unmerge protection is now observed for symlinks, fifos and
	device nodes.
	
	*portage.py
	Fixes for unmerging CONFIG_PROTECTed files.  Protected files are now *not*
	unlinked from the filesystem.  Messier but safer, and simplifies package
	upgrades.

	*emerge
	Emerge output cleanups for GNU info directory generation.  New --verbose
	mode; new CONFIG_PROTECT scanning feature to let people know when there are
	config files to be updated.  New "--help config" docs to explain how to
	do it.

Portage 1.6.6, released 01 Sep 2001
====================================

	*portage.py
	Upgraded directory merging over existing objects.  Existing symlinks that
	point to existing directories will be kept and used as is; directories will
	be used as-is; any other objects (broken symlinks, files) will be copied
	to origfilename.backup and a ne directory will be created in its place.

Portage 1.6.5, released 31 Aug 2001
====================================
	
	*emerge 
	Fixes for handling multiple ebuilds, packages and/or dependencies on
	the command-line.

	*portage.py 
	An optimization to the digraph class so that the firstzero() method finds
	matches in close to the order that keys were added to the digraph.
