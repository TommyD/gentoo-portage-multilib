  sync'ing without a tree like it should. Parser returns an exception with
  the parse error now for getconfig(). TGL's patch for another cache issue
  in class config. Modified the /etc/make.profile message. Fix for the
  "eclass does not exist" messages on sync.

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Fix the repopath
  so that it cna be run outside of cvs repos. 

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Add portage's
  pym path to SANDBOX_PREDICT to stunt any further .pyc/.pyo problems. Add
  nofetch to the 'successful' kill list to stop the $T definition woes.

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: repoman should
  read each arch virtual file. This should close #40813.

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed -s/-S

*portage-2.0.50 (06 Feb 2003): Release -- API change, cleanups, speedups

  06 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: repoman got a quick fix
  from genone. Ed's fix for ask/pretend. Made sure that emerge force-updated
  the eclass cache before trying to update all the metadata. masking type
  patch from Genone. masking info patch and regenworld patch added.

*portage-2.0.50_pre22 (04 Feb 2003): Cleanups and stablizing

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: TGL's fixes
  for exec/child/wait problems. Unset GREP_OPTIONS GREP_COLOR. has() and use()
  no longer attempt to determine if they are to be quiet or noisy -- They
  default to noisy -- useq() and hasq() are the non-verbose versions.
  EBUILD_PHASE set to add a hack-ish way around global scope calls in
  eclasses -- NOTHING SHOULD BE CALLED IN THE GLOBAL SCOPE. Touchup to the
  inherit() code that should finally allow the removal of the ECLASS and
  INHERITED settings. Removed tty (use/has) calls. Removed dirname calls --
  portage.py handles setting the dbkey filename now.
  
  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Ed Catmur's
  (with a  little TGL added in) patch for --ask. Added a 'metadata' target
  that skips the sync and only updates the cache. FEATURES="getbinpkg" added.
  TGL's exit code fixes. Fixed match code for -S so it doesn't complain about
  specific and double versions. Unmerge via dbpath fix. Rewrote rsync's
  options that supports --verbose and --quiet operation now and can force
  checksumming all files using --debug. Sort the files in the cache update
  so it's a little more predictable. 

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: changed 
  --strip-debug to --strip-unneeded.

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Updates to
  enable HTTP/HTTPS authentication.

  04 Feb 04; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: best_from_dict
  added to grab the best entry from set of dicts using a list of the keys for
  priority. jstubb's patch to fix listdir -- splits it into a cache and list
  setup. jstubb's patch for varexpand to handle $VAR better. Latexer's patch
  for KernelVersion code to use Makefiles instead of the version.h. Modules
  are loaded from /etc/portage/modules or defaults, whichever works. Fixed
  the /etc/make.profile-is-missing traceback. Spawn can be given 3 pipes to
  redirect stdin,stdout,stderr to specific outputs, terminals, or files.
  TGL's patch for cache functions in portage.py so that they do not cache at
  inappropriate times. PORTAGE_TMPFS is now used if set as a temporary file
  operation area -- recommended to actually be a ramfs/tmpfs filesystem for
  speed. Genone enhanced the deprecated profile patch.

  31 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed --skipfirst
  bug. This closes #36880.

  29 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: TGL's patch
  for imporving overlay verbose. This closes #39765.

  27 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  autouse bug. autouse were ignored.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Output failed
  cache updates during emerge sync.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: VDB_PATH fixes.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only use
  custom profiles when not called by repoman. ROOT never changes profile
  roots, only custom/system profiles var/cache/edb/virtuals. Sandbox fix
  where sandbox was creating an invalid logfile (not giving a summary)
  due to a '/' in SANDBOX_LOG. Turned down the Lockfile output. Double
  check the INCOMPLETE MERGE identifications as it can be caused by cache.

  24 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved timestamp check 
  when 'emerge sync'. Added catching amiguous error when unmerge.
  This closes #24325.

  23 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py: Fixed 2 bugs. 
  Portage doesn't read local virtuals file, which happens on only cvs
  version. package is blocked by itself.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  Fix from genone for emerge's direct reading of packages and his patch
  that also adds in /etc/portage/profile as a stacked profile.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Completed
  inheritence capabilities for portage.config reading some files. Moved a
  copy of the getvirtuals() function into settings to handle multiple
  profiles properly.

*portage-2.0.50_pre17/18/19 (21 Jan 2004): Modules for DBs and quick fixes

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Moved all references
  to var/db/pkg to portage.VDB_PATH --- This will change again -- NEED TO
  BE MOVED INTO A PATH/CONSTANTS SETUP.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dosed: Quick fix for
  the basename missing/misplaced issue.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added
  /dev/console to PREDICT to attempt a workaround for a serial console
  bug. dbkey is now set through portage.py/doebuild to allow for modular
  db code.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: regen doesn't
  require root anymore. Edited the timestamp check to be a little more
  friendly -- delete the portdir timestamp and it won't use the alternate.
  Fix some permission settings. Added some warnings in for cachedirs that
  are very likely to ruin your system. Cleaned out some of the eclass code
  that isnt valid any longer.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portageq: Added vdb_path
  as a target to get the db directory. Quickpkg uses this.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  load_mod() -- grabs a class/function from a module and passes it back
  without loading the module into the global scope. Added unique_array()
  which eliminates duplicates from an array. grab_stacked() operates like
  the other grab* and getconfig functions, but takes a filename and a set
  of paths that it will apply incrementally or clobbers -- for profile
  inheritance. getconfig no longer exits on non-existance returns None.
  Class config now should be passed a profile path and a set of incremental
  values instead of using the globals -- defaults to using the globals
  presently and print an error message. Adding support for module configs
  as a set of strings 'class.subclass.objectmodule':'module.to.use.object'
  for load_mod and the database modules. Profile inheritance started. Killed
  the eclass() super-function and replaced it with class eclass_cache that
  is visible and conceptually simpler -- Also uses the plugable modules.
  Cleaned out the sync calls for the DBs. MASSIVE simplification of the
  aux_get code -- removed memory-caching in favor of system cache (actually
  faster in all cases so far -- P100 and P4-2.2G). Lockfile usage around the
  cachefile.
  
  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Updated
  the API a little but to have permissions set properly. A little more
  reorganization and removed the keycount checks.

  21 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: download size 
  should not be displayed when the package is nomerge with --tree.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reverted
  ambiguity package fix in cpv_expand().

  backing up the timestamp.chk fix.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved the
  list of --tree by TGL's patch. This should close #38070.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Removed debug
  message without --debug. This should close #23840.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved
  timestamp check of rsync. This should close #37403.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Improved
  regeneration ld.so.cache. This should close #37858.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which
  emerge doesn't block same package but different version.
  (example: DEPEND="!<cat/pkg-1.0.0" in cat/pkg-1.0.0.ebuild)

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Modified cpv_expand() to check package.mask. This should close #38592.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Escaped
  regualar expression for replace entry in fixdbentries().

  18 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fixed AUTOCLEAN delay problem in .50pre* by TGL's patch. This close 
  #38189. Fixed unmerge failture bug when 'ebuild foo-1.0.0 unmerge'.
  These close #38189, #38366

  18 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py:
  Fixed "ebuild /foo/bar-1.0.0.ebuild unmerge" and "emerge bar-1.0.0 unmerge"

  class to have class lockfiles for the db and tmpdb dirs as well as lock
  other files before editing. Reorganization of the merge code in dblink
  so that the tmpdb is filled immediately after preinst and prior to the

  uses pkg settings now instead of env and backup. Genone's custom mirror
  patch included. Added some missing 'strict' flags for recursion in digest*().
  Refixed the invalidentry stuff that was lost across patch merges. Fix for
  pkg-keywords from genone included. Genone's deprecated profile patch for
  reporting to a user that their current profile is deprecated. Message about
  missing arch.list instead of spouting invalid keywords messages.

  08 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman:
  Added all arch dependency check. This closes bug #24160.

  07 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge,portage.py:
  Fixed bugs. 1.--debug doesn't work 2.Portage breaks files
  in /var/db/*/*. 3.No stop if dependency problem happens.
  They are only cvs version problems.

  01 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which 
  always remakes info dir file.

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed issue with
  ebuild name rule. Fixed typo with variable name.
  This closes bug #17172,#34666

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed issue with 
  lacking the "setting" argument for pkgmerge()

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed rsync bug.
  This closes bug #34660.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Migration
  to non-global settings started -- class config has new functionality and
  is locked after portage is finished initializing -- changes cannot be made
  to the global instance of config 'settings' -- reset() is now functional,
  setcpv() loads PKGUSE from /etc/portage/package.use, load_infodir() loads
  all small files (under 4k) from the vardb directory of an installed package
  so that operations have the same post* settings as they had at merge time.
  Begin modifications to spawn() to allow for files/pipes to be used for
  IO instead of using getstatusoutput which does not take an environment
  parameter like execve(). check_config_instance() ensures that the provided
  parameter is a 'class config' instance -- for ensuring that everything is
  being passed properly with the changes. Fix for the local FS mirror issue
  where it removed the first '/' instead of the last one. doebuild() cleanups
  for readability and pkguse enhancements -- also remove getstatusoutput()
  usage for depend so that we don't have to modify the active environment.
  Fix for symlink mtime values returned from movefile. (Nakano) SLOTMOVE
  added to global update functionality to fix some issues where a package
  suddenly must become slotted. portdbapi takes a root parameter instead
  of using settings. Slightly more useful output from depend. binarytree()
  now takes a pkgdir instead of using settings. Portage will now die if
  ebuild.sh exits on a signal.
  
  Moved some functions around and renamed them for general use -- derived
  from match2 in class portagetree:
  match_to_list() find all atoms in a list that match a given package.
  best_match_to_list() determines the most specific match. Needs work.
  match_from_list() find all packages in a list that match a given atom.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed an issue
  with searchdesc wanting root permissions if run as non-root. Migrated to
  the non-global config class. EMERGE_FROM added for the dyn_preinst patch
  -- Indicates if a merge is occuring from an ebuild or from a binary. Patch
  for rsync timestamp checking from Nakano.
  
  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Save PKGUSE.
  Pebeneto's patch for dyn_preinst and SELinux added as a fix for binary
  and ebuild merges. Added a kill for portage during the depend phase so
  that portage will actually die if you control-C.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: MASSIVE set of changes
  to start using locally defined 'class config' instances. This allows us to
  start working on some parallelism among other things. Created this way:
  mysettings = portage.config(clone=portage.settings)
  
  The Following functions now take a 'config' parameter:
  spawn(), fetch(), digestgen(), digestcheck(), spawnebuild(), doebuild(),
  merge(), dep_opconvert(), dep_check(), dblink.__init__()
  
  package.keywords is now implemented curtasy of genone/max. PKGUSE was
  rewritten for the global config killing and is also included. X11 man
  pages now found and zipped correctly. SYS.PATH fixes for the python
  migration -- issue actually only shows up on 2.2 systems because of how
  compiled modules are used if found regardless of the original source's
  existance.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> tabcheck.py: An easier
  way to make sure that all the python stuff is correctly using tabs and
  not mixing spaces.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> xpak, xpak.py: Fixes
  to ensure that it works if the current dir is missing and that the python
  path gets set properly.
  
  22 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  calls in vartree method to invalidentry().... made them call call
  self.dbapi.invalidentry() (there were multiple wrong method calls.)
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> md5check.py: Checks all
  digests and SRC_URIs for filenames and associated MD5s. Reports collisions
  between versions/packages, missing, and extra lines in digests.

*portage-2.0.49-r17/18 (10 Nov 2003): Fixes

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Changed portage to
  be the first path in sys.path for all python scripts. Also enabled
  optimizations from the scripts to ensure everything imported is built
  for speed. ebuild: applied fix for the '//' root breaking the db[].
  prepstrip: etdyn quickfix
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix for
  RESTRICT=nouserpriv. GENTOO_MIRRORS can have paths set to take files
  from. Fixes for mishandled cache data regarding *pkgsplit(). Fixes for
  '*' being returned as part of a package split. An 'invalidentry()' fix
  for a traceback. Nakano's fixes for virtual removals not working properly,
  sandbox violations during pkg_nofetch, || depend selection. Genone's
  fixpackages speedup.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: PORTAGE_TMPDIR
  fix for distcc. Variable passing bug patch for export_functions. Exit 1
  added for nofetch to stop sandbox violation. Nakano's --tree patch added.
  Improved the unmerge messages to denote what kind of unmerge fails. Info
  pages regex pattern adjusted to allow most any name for a page.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: genone's xml
  linting additions.

  01 Nov 2003; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py:
  fix bug #32071, by properly escaping a string to not be a regex. Checked
  thru entire *.py tree and found this is the only mis-use of strings that
  need to be escaped.

  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: /lib/modules
  now gets "unmerge protection." This is half of the config protection
  functionality. It means that anything in /lib/modules will not be deleted
  when a package is unmerged (often automatically when a user merges a
  kernel module ebuild for a new kernel.) This solves the "my module
  disappeared!" issue. This closes bug #1477.
  
  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: Should no longer
  spit out wacky "!!! no match found" warnings when auto-cleaning.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only run
  depscan.sh if it exists on disk. This allows Portage to run inside a stage1
  where /sbin/depscan.sh doesn't exist.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Applied fix to
  allow multi-level "use? (   )" in SRC_URI, closing bug #16159.

*portage-2.0.49-r15/16 (21 Oct 2003): Fixes

  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> fix-db.py: was broken
  for python2.3 -- fixed now.
  
  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  lockfiles to prelink md5 checks. Fixed caching bug where cache objects
  were passed back as pointers instead of copies. Added 'invalidentry'
  function to handle lockfiles -- It tests/deletes them using unlockfile.
  Added fix-db.py to the 'databases is broken' messages.

  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: added CDPATH
  to unset. SELinux fix for sandbox.
