  MAJOR CHANGES in 2.0.51:
    1. /var/cache/edb/virtuals is no longer used at all. It's calculated now.
    2. /var/cache/edb/world is now /var/lib/portage/world.
    3. /etc/portage/profile/virtuals is _USER_ configs only.
    4. /etc/portage/sets/world is a symlink to /var/lib/portage/world
       It is for convenience. Do not mistake this for the actual file.

*portage-2.0.51_pre18 (16 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness & GPG
  
  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dolib*: Added LV's
  CONF_LIBDIR patch to help out the 32/64 bit lib migrations.
	
  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: CONF_LIBDIR
  patch updates. Added a possible fix for the export issues in environment.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepall/lib: CONF_LIBDIR

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Adjusted the
  manifest/gpg code to reduce the output on missing sigs. Changed the GPG
  homedir to the PORTAGE_GPG_DIR instead of using rsync for the keyring --
  This requires manual intervention.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> sandbox: Added the 32/64
  paths in for 32/64 lib migrations.

  16 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py 
  pym/portage.py: Round #2 of ignorecvs, now w/ sane regex goodness and an 
  addition to digest(gen|check) to use the same cvs filter for Manifests.
  (#46070).

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: message fix for
	packages.provided.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Made file.size
	a warning for the time being.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cvstree.py: Removed the
	auto-ignore regex as it is broken AND it breaks Manifests due to excess
	files allowed into them.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: A couple changes
  to the select_dep exception handling for the signing code.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> env-update.sh: Added
  Spanky's env-update  shell script version.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Moved more
  code into seperate modules. Added support for Manifest verification and
  usage of 'gpg' 'strict' 'severe' to enable various condition responses.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_const.py: Moved
  all constants to this module. (All uppercase defines)

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_data.py: Contains
  all calculated information. uid/gid info. system-specific values. All probed
  information should go here.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py:
  Added many exceptions for the GPG verification code. Added many general
  exceptions to help differentiate from explicit portage exceptions and
  those issued by python.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_gpg.py: Handling
  of gpg verification code and keyring management/trust.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Moved
  the lock code out of portage.py.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_md5.py: Moved the
  MD5 calculation code out of portage.py.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: Moved
  writemsg and unique_array into portage_util.

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Added 
  support for ECONF_LIBDIR; if it isn't defined, then --libdir isn't 
  passed to the configure script.  If it is defined, then the configure 
  script gets --libdir=/usr/${ECONF_LIBDIR}.

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py: 
  Added robbat2's patch to ignore files that cvs ignores. (#46070). 

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Shifted 
  the add* sandbox function definitions to before profile.bashrc srcing.
  As bug #60147 demonstrated, profiles occasionally need to adjust 
  SANDBOX_WRITE (current case being for /usr/lib64/{conftest,cf}).

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Related to 
  bug #60256, adjusted format_size so that is always returns a string.

  13 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Relocated blocker checking code to before pkgsettings.setcpv() is called
  on it in depgraph.create()

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Tweaked lockfile, so it attempts a non-blocking lock_ex first, then
  states it's waiting on lock blar, then attempts a blocking lock.  This 
  will be useful for informing the user why portage seems to have hung, 
  and good for debugging.

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge-webrsync:
  Added support for snapshot md5sum's (mirrors now carry them).
  This is used to ensure the fetched snapshot is sane; if it's sane, 
  then we reuse it for sync'ing.  This nulls the -n option, so it's been
  removed. Closes out #15990, but no longer automatically forcing a refetch.
  Refetches are only forced if the md5 is invalid.

  12 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Cleaned up fetch a bit more, saner error messages when unable to 
  write to DISTDIR.

  12 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixed the fix for the earlier traceback on installed package not being
  in PORTDIR to remove duplicate work.

  11 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: 
  Added FEATURES="autoconfig" support. (#55476)

  11 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Added check to lockfile and fetch, if file already is owned by 
  portage group, don't try and chown it.  This will close #60079.

  10 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Fixed a 
  traceback issue, an ebuild is no longer in the tree, but is installed 
  and needs to be used in the depgraph- the problem was, emerge 
  assumed the ebuild was in porttree's db, when vartree should be used 
  if the package is known to be installed.

  10 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Killed a couple of corner cases for non-root fetch and lockfile calls.

  10 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py
  bin/ebuild.sh: Add check to ensure that install phase has been 
  ran prior to qmerge phase being attempted.  This can happen 
  when the user is using ebuild to step through the phases.
  Corrected bug in listdir where it would return None, rather then 
  []- all callee's expect a returned list, not None.  Same for ftype,
  cause's a tb if you just haphazardly rely on cachedir's return.

  09 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Leave /var/tmp with it's own permissions, chowning/chmoding just 
  /var/tmp/portage (#37521).

  09 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh 
  pym/portage.py: Corrected bug in profile.bashrc support, added aliases 
  for saving/restoring IFS (remove_path_entry and profile.bashrc loop 
  adjust IFS temporarily).  Closes #59749.

  08 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf: 
  Converted os.rename calls to shutil.move; the former can't cross fs's,
  the latter can. (#46148)

  07 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  cache updates so that an env-update forces ld updating.
  
  07 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py
  pym/portage_dep.py: Added a new parameter to use_reduce so that !arch?
  checks can be adhered to even when matchall=1 and arch is not is masklist.

  07 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py
  pym/portage_dep.py: Added profile masked use flags to repoman check.
  Moved || refactoring to a separate function. Reworked use_reduce logic
  into simpler sections.

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  What can I say, I can't get enough of bug (#59574).
  I'm operating under the assumption there still is a bug in the 
  use_reduce logic, soo I've left a fairly massive amount of debugging 
  code in place that's currently disabled.  It's *very* useful for 
  tracking exactly what/how use_reduce decides on a operator node.

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  I introduced a bug in the previous commit, basically 
  portage.settings.archlist list of arch keywords was being actively 
  pruned by repoman as it stepped through arches for dep checking.
  Basically, needed to make a copy of archlist rather then using the 
  actual archlist object.  Should be the final issue for (#59574).

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fix 
  in the same area, if use="all" (repoman wants -every use flag- checked),
  it should call use_reduce w/ matchall set appropriately. (#59574)

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: And...
  repoman's arch check got hosed again.  The code in dep_check for 
  building a masklist was incorrect, 3 line fix. (#59574)

*portage-2.0.51_pre17 (03 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness

  03 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Again
  fixed the || exceptions to understand nested legal || statements.

*portage-2.0.51_pre16 (03 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Changed the
  virtual/glibc references to virtual/libc.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepman: No longer runs
  gzip on .keep files.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Added in
  an active/passive option for FTP connections -- Requires the appending of
  an asterisk to the HOST portion of the ftp string to use active connections.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.conf*: Updates for
  the active-connection ftp option.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emergehelp.py: Removed
  the bin/ version and replaced it with a duplicated pym/ version.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Added check to ensure /var/tmp/portage's permissions were sane. (#56665)

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added 
  explicit check for missing files directory, rather then ignoring it.
  Also added an explicit commit-time check for CVS/Entries being sane.
  (#57141).

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: reworked 
  the qacats definition so that the type of bug that borked emerge help is 
  no longer possible.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, 
  bin/emerge: Corrected emerge --fetch-all-uri issues, now works.  Basically,
  FEATURES="cvs" emerge -f blar == emerge --fetch-all-uri blar.  The fetch
  option handling in emerge could use some cleanup.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Ongoing 
  cleanup in emerge -fp; this corrects a minor naggle affecting previous 
  releases, where emerge -fp would still attempt to do md5 checks on files.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Corrected 
  logic for fetch(..., ..., use_locks=1,listonly=1) attempting to use locks, 
  when fetch is just printing the src_uri's.  (#59394).

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected the
  borkage I introduced into repoman's help option- it was throwing a traceback
  due to file.executable's key name being typoed.

  03 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Enhanced
  the invalid depend string identification for || (and &&) strings.

*portage-2.0.51_pre15 (03 Aug 2003): Fixes and Public Readiness

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected 
  typo, trying to remove .backup_metadata.dtd rather then metadata.dtd.

  03 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Changing
  from dep_opconvert to use_reduce introduced a bug due to how OR'd lists are
  managed by the remaining dep handling functions -- Fixed by emulating the
  format in use_reduce.

  02 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman, pym/portage.py:
  Added local caching of metadata.dtd, to prevent flaky connections from 
  flagging a packages metadata.xml as invalid due to xmllint failing to fetch 
  metadata.dtd.  Simplified version of patch in (#57210).

  02 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh, 
  pym/portage.py:  Added support for src'ing a profile bashrc.  Fex, if
  /etc/make.profile/profile.bashrc exists, it is sourced prior to ebuild.sh
  defining any of it's functions.  (#58415).

  02 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge-webrsync: General
  cleanup; uses the make.conf defined FETCHCOMMAND for fetching (fixing #57887),
  runs emerge metadata after a successful sync also.

*portage-2.0.51_pre14 (02 Aug 2003): Fixes and Public Readiness

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> do*: Added exit calls
  on failures and changed the install to use short options for BSD compat.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: unset
  GLOBIGNORE added. Echo out the confingure command from econf. Moved the
  maketest code to dyn_preinst so it didn't force-run maketest. Added a
  patch for keyword expansion (requires portage-2.0.51 for use).

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: --fetch-all-uri
  added to force all URIs to be downloaded (works like features=cvs). libc
  version printing enhancements. Fixed the binary package selection in an
  alt ROOT. Headers and libtool added to info. --ask removed on a resume.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: Change ewarn
  to echos to stderr with beeps.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Added to the
  OK message output for issues that fail.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.conf: Typo correction
  patch added.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: Added kterm
  to the titlebar terminals.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added a message
  regarding the location of the virtuals file (move to /etc/portage/profiles).
  Added a invalid-mirror message and a missing URI message for fetching. Added
  the selinux sandbox patch. Removed the old dep_opconvert call as all ?:
  syntax is gone.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Fixed the
  use_reduce code to properly handle negative requirements on masked flags.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> tbz2tool.c: Made all the
  comments to C style.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> libsandbox: Code from
  Seth Robertson that tracked down all adjuct flags for read operations that
  did not invoke a write operation.

  01 Aug 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added
  message about ._cfg* files after emerge sync.

  01 Aug 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Modified 
  updating /etc/portage/package.* logic to see  CONFIG_PROTECT and 
  CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK.

  01 Aug 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Added a warning for `emerge /path/to/ebuild`

  01 Aug 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixing broken logic for the `emerge rsync` deprecation notice (it only showed
  up on `emerge --rsync`).

  01 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py bin/emerge:
  Fixed the lockfile/unlockfile functions so that they correctly support having
  an int passed in (the fd #), or having a file object passed in.  Corrected 
  lockfile so that the lock is owned by portage group, with g+w permissions
  (this is needed since sudo emerge blar can bail, leaving a stale lock that 
  non-root usage cannot remove).  Added locking to emerge's emergelog function, 
  preventing log messages from potentially getting mixed together.  Added check 
  to fetch function to complain if unable to write to DISTDIR (previously the 
  fetcher just bailed, stepping through each src_uri).  Added lockfiles for 
  fetching/md5ing of the src- these lockfiles are stored in a subdirectory 
  (locks_in_subdir=".locks") if specified, and locking is controlled via 
  use_locks (defaults to on).  emerge -f no longer requires root/sudo to run 
  (ebuild never had this restriction). (#42969)

  31 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py bin/emerge:
  Removed USE-based SLOT support. Removed uselist from getslot methods.

  29 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added check for
  files over 20k in a packages files directory.  file.size, repoman treats it 
  as a a failure.  Added the repoman manpage entries for file.size, and 
  file.executable (I missed file.executable earlier).

  28 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fixed a bug
  emerge doesn't pkg_setup() with -k/-K option. (#25152)

  28 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added ._cfg* file for updating /etc/portage/packages.* during global
  update.

  28 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emergehelp.py,
  man/emerge.1: Added explanation of --newuse to manpage/help. 
  Added information of --verbose to manpage.

  27 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Reversed the order of profile virtuals (dirVirtuals) so that a cascading
  profile's virtuals are stacked in the correct order.

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Removed the `which blah` calls- A) stage1 lacks which, B) which searches
  $PATH- all sane shells do this already when handed a command that 
  isn't absolute path.  These which calls were used in 
  commands.getstatusoutput() calls, which starts up a shell with
  the arg passed to the shell, so "`which blar` args" isn't needed.

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Added file.executable check- ebuilds, digests, Manifest, ChangeLog, and
  metadata.xml don't need the executable bit set.  CVS preserves it upon 
  commit, so we do the check prior to commit.  (#55647)

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Removed the hardcoding of uname for emerge info, using which to find it
  instead.

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Added check to ensure manifest recommit is at least possible when 
  committing, and corrected handling of CVS/Root files for OSX machines.
  Removed readline import, doesn't seem to be used at all.

  26 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Refactored slot code into portage.py to remove usage off portage_dep.

  25 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/dohtml:
  Corrected a bug in dohtml where it was unable to install files with a space 
  in their name (#58258)

  25 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Deprecated --inject and added support for package.provided in both the
  profiles and /etc/portage/profile directory.

  24 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Added USE flag based SLOT support.

  24 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Added USE flag based PROVIDE support. (#32114)

  24 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> src/sandbox-1.1/libsandbox.c:
  Fixed lchown sandbox bug. (#58084)

  23 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected a 
  false positive on the ebuild.nesteddie check.  Basically it wasn't looking 
  to see if the line was active or not (fex # (die), bash skips, but repoman 
  caught).  Aside from that, that check is still capable of missing multiline 
  ebuild.nesteddie instances.  (#33011)

  22 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Re-enabled
  binary QA interceptors, with a minor twist- the QA_INTERCEPTORS is used to 
  specify what QA interceptors will be defined.  These functions are no longer
  saved in the ebuild's stored env (exist *only* in depend phase), and have been 
  expanded to identify if it's the ebuild, or eclass that's triggering the QA 
  Notice (#54652).  The interceptors behaviour when the binary is missing has 
  been corrected to correctly output "missing command $bin: args".

  21 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Fixed bug 
  which blocks a package itself with -U option.

  20 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Fixed
  profile cache problem. (#43601, #56170)

  20 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  added usev() and hasv() as complement to useq() and hasq().

  18 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected 
  ebuild.allmasked check, so that it checks for an available version across all
  arches, rather then the last arch processed.  Typo fixed also- bugs #57356 and
  #57068.

  17 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added patch from
  #49126 that makes repoman check that a USE flag from use.local.desc applies
  to the packages that make use of it.

  14 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  added a deprecation warning for --upgradeonly

  14 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/etc-update:
  Added a hint to etc-update so people that don't know what to do don't use -3
  or -5 by accident.

  12 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Adjusted masked binary checking code to exclude --usepkgonly.

  10 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> man/portage.5:
  Adjusted documentation for user use.mask to match implementation.

*portage-2.0.51_pre13 (09 Jul 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Included
  ferringb's logic fix for the repoman code. Fix that prevents vardb from
  using all files and directories in the vardb as keys instead of only the
  proper ones. Code touchups.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: Fixes that
  result in BSD compat and split the regex -- find doesn't do extended.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: included a uname
  fix for bsd. Added --fetch-all-uri as a way to get all URIs downloaded for
  a package regardless of conditionals.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Moved the
  declaration of ebuild_phase toward the top.

  09 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixed incorrect assignment of depgraph.mydbapi[] objects.

  07 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Solved a big memory problem in repoman where a full scan required several

  double-check files in symlinked dirs with wrong pathnames.

  26 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/regenworld: Fixed 
  regenworld. It always failed without -h or --help.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Disabled the
  URL encoding for BINHOST as it will take a lot of work to get it right.
  Execve try/except added to handle missing binaries and such. Changed the

  and to incrementally add any packages added to the dep graph.
  (#1343, #8810, #54608)

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fixed CONFIG_PROTECT/CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK in /etc/csv.env(#51646).

  08 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added the collision-protect feature that prevents packages from
  overwriting files they don't own. Has to be enabled with 
  FEATURES=collision-protect  as it needs more testing before it 
  can be enabled by default (bug #28228).

  05 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Fix rpm support by changing rpm to rpmbuild (bug #13508).

  to the colon_seperated list -- parsing code NEEDS TO BE FIXED. * and ~*
  matches allowed for package.use for arch-development -- ~* implies *.

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fix for a new
  typo in the logger function that prevented emerge.log from being written.

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: make test
  only occurs when enabled in FEATURES and not in RESTRICT -- defaults OFF.

*portage-2.0.51_pre9 (22 May 2003): Speedups and bug fixes

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_template.py:
  Added in last-three caching for db modules. Ensuring that keys are strings.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_cpickle.py: Fix
  that ensures the Unpickler works properly.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Updates for
  environment files ordering in ebuild.sh. Added in normalize_path to handle
  the really annoying "'//' is a legal prefix" issue with os.path.normpath.
  Applied normalize_path to cacheddir() so that the keys match and we have
  more cache hits and better performance. Added statistics to to cacheddir
  available with noise=2. Do not return a blocker when doing a zerolist.
  Fixed the stacking functions to properly order the incrementals and apply
  the removals forward. Changed all string.atoi() to int(). Added in the
  selinux changes for spawning the fetch command. Added a patch that allows
  ebuild.sh to display 'validcommands'. close_caches() added to allow atexit
  to close all the DB connections. close_portdbapi_cache() handles the global
  that has all db instances -- This avoids problems with the API nulling the
  internal links. Adjusted the db handling for sync() calls and removed some
  object duplication db calls.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Fix for HTTP
  redirects (301 and 302) so that the redirect opens a new connection to the
  move-location server -- This allows us to redirect to a different machine.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: For iuse output we
  now ensure that the correct db is referenced. The worldfile additions do not
  occur when a packages is new and updates are not being performed. Patch to
  add binutils to the emerge info.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Rearranged the
  sourcing of the profiles and the special environment files. Added src_test
  as an optional test method -- Some packages are extremely dumb and need to
  be prevented from using this via RESTRICT.

  18 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Minor speed
  improvement in config.setcpv preventing a useless regenerate

  18 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reversed the
  order of config.getvirtuals' stack_dictlist call for correct ordering.

*portage-2.0.51_pre8 (16 May 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py: New
  file containing portage exceptions. Added 'CorruptionError' for the db code.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: New file
  that contains utility functions. Allows db_modules to use portage functions
  without a circular dependency. CODE IS DUPLICATED and needs to be fixed in
  portage.py to use this new module. grab*, getconfig, varexpand, pickle_*,
  ReadOnlyConfig

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Modules
  do not have an __init__ any longer -- module_init() is called by the
  template after loading the config and setting the 5 variables inside of
  the class. self.config is a ReadOnlyConfig object which is just a dict
  that you can't write to. Throws CorruptionError when the read functions
  return exceptions. 

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reversed the
  virtuals order so it matches the documented format. When an ebuild does not
  exist, we now raise a KeyError with a useful string. 'couple minutes' changed
  to 'couple of minutes' for Seemant. ;)

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip, ebuild.5,
  repoman.1: Typo corrections/text replacements.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added deprecation
  notice to 'emerge rsync' to favor 'emerge sync'. Modified the emerge.log
  code to not change permissions on the files beyond what is necessary -- NEEDS
  TO BECOME AN ADDITIVE FUNCTION. Produce a warning instead of a traceback
  when an ebuild does not exist for -U.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Touched up the
  logging stuff at the top. Removed extra_functions.sh. src_compile additions
  so that it can run make without having a config file requirement.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dobin,dosbin: Removed the
  duplicated stripping from the helper tools.

  09 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  fixed bug in use_reduce that caused returned list to be flattened.

  30 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  modified ebuild.sh error message on seemants and roger55s request.

*portage-2.0.51_pre7 (26 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed masking
  problems due to the new stacking functions and empty-value stripping.

*portage-2.0.51_pre6 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Dropped selinux
  from the IUSE complainer list.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Made it use the
  constants defined in portage.py for the world file.
  
  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Modifications
  so that the virtuals are incremented in the proper order and reversed the
  final values so that the first virtual is the 'best' one. Try to put the
  INHERITED variable back into the environment before calling out to portage.
  This makes the ECLASS QA notices actually valid.

*portage-2.0.51_pre5 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed name
  of the world file constant. Fixed the virtuals loading and vartree creation
  circular dep with a repitition hack. Fixed the virtuals loading function so
  that it doesn't destroy the virtuals before saving them.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed all the
  references to the world file to use portage constants. Made the verbose
  output for use flags call unique array to make sure values aren't duped.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Typo fix for
  inherited, and removed the delay.

*portage-2.0.51_pre4 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Creation of
  a great number of 'constants' that were hard coded in various places and
  now are created in a cascaded style, for the most part. Exception handling
  for the loading of modules added along with verbose messages about the
  exception being handled for user info. PRIVATE_PATH is a new constant that
  points to the new directory we will be using for portage internal data --
  It is a secure directory that only group portage may write, read, and scan.
  PORTAGE_CACHEDIR is deprecated -- The real cache directory is FHS and is a
  constant -- The dep cache is named specifically now as 'PORTAGE_DEPCACHEDIR'.
  
  **Changed the stacking functions** so they are quite a bit more sane -- They
  still need a little help though -- stack_* functions are now used to stack
  specific types instead of using grab_stacked "super functions" -- The naming
  is a little rough but intelligable.
  
  **VIRTUALS modification** The /var/cache/edb/virtuals file is unnecessary
  as portage now loads the provides from the vartree itself. /etc/portage
  may have a virtuals file that stacks on top of the var and profile virtuals.
  This also entails the removal of the virtual-file handling code (yay!).

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fix for the name
  change for PORTAGE_CACHEDIR to PORTAGE_DEPCACHEDIR.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added checks
  to ensure that use flags are properly mentioned in IUSE. Adjusted the QA
  Interceptors (function overrides for common app names) to make sure they
  don't interfere in weird cases -- Relying on 'type -p' now. Eclasses are
  checked for illegal inheritance modes (conditional-based). Increased the
  cache lines for an entry -- Added 'PROVIDE' and 8 empties.

  22 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  added a CVS Header check to repoman

  20 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  fix for getmaskingreason if the mask isn't in PORTDIR's package.mask (#48447)

  17 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: Fixed for
  python-2.2 compatibility.

*portage-2.0.51_pre3 (13 Apr 2003): Cleanups and small features.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Fixed the
  permissions issues regarding the umask problems with DB vars.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix for the
  import urllib call that was misspelled for PORTAGE_BINHOST. Genone's patch
  that allows FETCHCOMMAND_${PROTOCOL}. getmaskingreadon() from genone's
  package.mask display patch.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: For some reason
  people have a problem with my bad spelling of semi-common colors, so I added
  in requested changes for the color 'fuchsia'.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf: Comment
  fixes for the CHOST line. FEATURES modification.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf.conf: Removed
  the 'a' option.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Catagory searches
  added if search is prefixed with '@'. jstubbs/spider's fix for binary use
  flag passing problems worked in. Genone's patch for package.mask comment
  display. Patch to display warnings when unmerging system packages worked in.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Quieted up
  some output for use/has internally. Added a patch for the help output.
  Added functionality to pass down IUSE from eclasses. Made several variables
  readonly inside of ebuilds:
    P PN PV PVR PR A AA D EBUILD EMERGE_FROM O PPID FILESDIR EBUILD_PHASE

*portage-2.0.51_pre2 (11 Apr 2003): Release Fixes

  11 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Portage can now
  match categories if the search is prefixed with an '@' -- @app-portage will
  list all packages in app-portage... '@portage' will match all in app-portage
  and will match anything with portage in the title -- It's still a regex.

  11 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: nostrip in
  RESTRICT now enables DEBUGBUILD -- stripping and related functionality
  needs to get cleaned up better.

  11 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> etc-update, ebuild.sh:
  Fixed infinity loop in etc-update(#19144). Fixed glob problem in 
  ebuild.sh(#37066). Fixed deleting build-info problem with
  FEATURES="keepwork"(#29044).
  
  10 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Includes the
  deadlock breaks marked with 'XXX:' to indicate where fixes are needed. Added
  HTTP encoding to PORTAGE_BINHOST with checks and fallbacks. Fallback for
  dbkey settings spawned from ebuild. Exception handling for db classes in
  the case of random corruption. jstubb's fix for the dep code to handle
  empty lists, added a notice about that being rude.

  10 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Made more QA
  notices and made them slightly more pretty 'QA Notice:'. Made the depend
  phase trap less violent -TERM not -KILL.

  10 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: Added IUSE missings
  a check(#21544).

  10 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> tarball.sh, pym/portage.py:
  Fixing broken regexp in fixdbentries() (bug 46096), changing version
  number.

  10 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: Fixed unsafety
  temporary file name(#44455).

  01 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed 
  virtuals in reverse order(jstubbs's patch and my fix).
  This should close #45468.

  all the db modules to be current and correct and updated the testing code
  to make sure everything is working properly.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Removed some
  functions: evaluate, dep_listcleanup, dep_getjiggy. Made inheritance for
  profiles relative from the profile's directory instead of from the profile's
  base directory. OBSOLETING two functions dep_parenreduce and dep_opreduce in
  favor of the new code in portage_dep paren_reduce and use_reduce. dep_zapdeps
  got an overhaul for much more intelligent selection of packages and virtual
  handling during depgraph generation. Binary tree enhancements and selection
  enhancements. bindbapi created to do aux_get on binaries. isInjected added
  to vardbapi to get injected status. SRC_URI uses the new portage_dep code
  to handle strings now -- nesting should would flawlessly and FEATURES=cvs
  should get _all_ files.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_cpickle.py:
  Added pickle loading safety.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep: Temp home

  Fixed some repoman/portage bugs. repoman shouldn't use /etc/portage/*
  files. repoman shouldn't use PORTDIR_OVERLAY(#11335). repoman should use
  each arch profile dir(#43601). portage didn't handle virtual dependency
  with version (>=virtual/package-1.0) in some places.

  05 Mar 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Trivial fix for emerge -pv if the download size is a long.

  bin/emergehelp.py, man/emerge.1:
  Updated docs for --update and removed the "help" action (wasn't working
  anyway).

  29 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed 
  wrong USE in 'emerge info'. This should fix #34260.

  27 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed info dir
  regeneration produces errors with a non-C locale and misleading error 
  message. This should fix #41872,#24299.

  emerge.1: Added genone's patch for man/help of --tree option.

  27 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Removed

  26 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Added new option
  --newuse. This option is to rebuild a package whose USE has been changed.

  22 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py: speedup
  when /etc/portage/package.keywords is defined. Moved loading

  SRC_URI bug when FEATURES="cvs". This should close #16159.

  12 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, pym/portage.py:
  TGL's patch for correction package size when emerge -v. -- Fixed
  use.default bug. It occurs when package in use.default exists in system
  and it's virtual package. This should close #40831. 

  12 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed 
  --ask bugs. It breaks with "--clean". It also breaks when blocker
  exists.  This should close #39865.

  --ask bug with --changelog. This should close #41293.

  11 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emergehelp.py: Added
  help of F flag with emerge --pretend. This should close #28253.

*portage-2.0.50-r1 (09 Feb 2003): Release Fixes

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix the config
  code so that it doesn't fail when the profile does not exist -- allows
  sync'ing without a tree like it should. Parser returns an exception with
  the parse error now for getconfig(). TGL's patch for another cache issue
  in class config. Modified the /etc/make.profile message. Fix for the
  "eclass does not exist" messages on sync.

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Fix the repopath
  so that it cna be run outside of cvs repos. 

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Add portage's
  pym path to SANDBOX_PREDICT to stunt any further .pyc/.pyo problems. Add
  nofetch to the 'successful' kill list to stop the $T definition woes.

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: repoman should
  read each arch virtual file. This should close #40813.

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed -s/-S 
  bug. "Latest version installed:" was incorrect. This should fix #40847

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed ldconfig
  bug. emerge didn't ldconfig after removing library directory.
  This should fix #40694.

*portage-2.0.50 (06 Feb 2003): Release -- API change, cleanups, speedups

  06 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: repoman got a quick fix
  from genone. Ed's fix for ask/pretend. Made sure that emerge force-updated
  the eclass cache before trying to update all the metadata. masking type
  patch from Genone. masking info patch and regenworld patch added.

*portage-2.0.50_pre22 (04 Feb 2003): Cleanups and stablizing

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: TGL's fixes
  for exec/child/wait problems. Unset GREP_OPTIONS GREP_COLOR. has() and use()
  no longer attempt to determine if they are to be quiet or noisy -- They
  default to noisy -- useq() and hasq() are the non-verbose versions.
  EBUILD_PHASE set to add a hack-ish way around global scope calls in
  eclasses -- NOTHING SHOULD BE CALLED IN THE GLOBAL SCOPE. Touchup to the
  inherit() code that should finally allow the removal of the ECLASS and
  INHERITED settings. Removed tty (use/has) calls. Removed dirname calls --
  portage.py handles setting the dbkey filename now.
  
  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Ed Catmur's
  (with a  little TGL added in) patch for --ask. Added a 'metadata' target
  that skips the sync and only updates the cache. FEATURES="getbinpkg" added.
  TGL's exit code fixes. Fixed match code for -S so it doesn't complain about
  specific and double versions. Unmerge via dbpath fix. Rewrote rsync's
  options that supports --verbose and --quiet operation now and can force
  checksumming all files using --debug. Sort the files in the cache update
  so it's a little more predictable. 

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: changed 
  --strip-debug to --strip-unneeded.

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Updates to
  enable HTTP/HTTPS authentication.

  04 Feb 04; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: best_from_dict
  added to grab the best entry from set of dicts using a list of the keys for
  priority. jstubb's patch to fix listdir -- splits it into a cache and list
  setup. jstubb's patch for varexpand to handle $VAR better. Latexer's patch
  for KernelVersion code to use Makefiles instead of the version.h. Modules
  are loaded from /etc/portage/modules or defaults, whichever works. Fixed
  the /etc/make.profile-is-missing traceback. Spawn can be given 3 pipes to
  redirect stdin,stdout,stderr to specific outputs, terminals, or files.
  TGL's patch for cache functions in portage.py so that they do not cache at
  inappropriate times. PORTAGE_TMPFS is now used if set as a temporary file
  operation area -- recommended to actually be a ramfs/tmpfs filesystem for
  speed. Genone enhanced the deprecated profile patch.

  31 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed --skipfirst
  bug. This closes #36880.

  29 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: TGL's patch
  for imporving overlay verbose. This closes #39765.

  27 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  autouse bug. autouse were ignored.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Output failed
  cache updates during emerge sync.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: VDB_PATH fixes.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only use
  custom profiles when not called by repoman. ROOT never changes profile
  roots, only custom/system profiles var/cache/edb/virtuals. Sandbox fix
  where sandbox was creating an invalid logfile (not giving a summary)
  due to a '/' in SANDBOX_LOG. Turned down the Lockfile output. Double
  check the INCOMPLETE MERGE identifications as it can be caused by cache.

  24 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved timestamp check 
  when 'emerge sync'. Added catching amiguous error when unmerge.
  This closes #24325.

  23 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py: Fixed 2 bugs. 
  Portage doesn't read local virtuals file, which happens on only cvs
  version. package is blocked by itself.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  Fix from genone for emerge's direct reading of packages and his patch
  that also adds in /etc/portage/profile as a stacked profile.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Completed
  inheritence capabilities for portage.config reading some files. Moved a
  copy of the getvirtuals() function into settings to handle multiple
  profiles properly.

*portage-2.0.50_pre17/18/19 (21 Jan 2004): Modules for DBs and quick fixes

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Moved all references
  to var/db/pkg to portage.VDB_PATH --- This will change again -- NEED TO
  BE MOVED INTO A PATH/CONSTANTS SETUP.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dosed: Quick fix for
  the basename missing/misplaced issue.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added
  /dev/console to PREDICT to attempt a workaround for a serial console
  bug. dbkey is now set through portage.py/doebuild to allow for modular
  db code.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: regen doesn't
  require root anymore. Edited the timestamp check to be a little more
  friendly -- delete the portdir timestamp and it won't use the alternate.
  Fix some permission settings. Added some warnings in for cachedirs that
  are very likely to ruin your system. Cleaned out some of the eclass code
  that isnt valid any longer.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portageq: Added vdb_path
  as a target to get the db directory. Quickpkg uses this.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  load_mod() -- grabs a class/function from a module and passes it back
  without loading the module into the global scope. Added unique_array()
  which eliminates duplicates from an array. grab_stacked() operates like
  the other grab* and getconfig functions, but takes a filename and a set
  of paths that it will apply incrementally or clobbers -- for profile
  inheritance. getconfig no longer exits on non-existance returns None.
  Class config now should be passed a profile path and a set of incremental
  values instead of using the globals -- defaults to using the globals
  presently and print an error message. Adding support for module configs
  as a set of strings 'class.subclass.objectmodule':'module.to.use.object'
  for load_mod and the database modules. Profile inheritance started. Killed
  the eclass() super-function and replaced it with class eclass_cache that
  is visible and conceptually simpler -- Also uses the plugable modules.
  Cleaned out the sync calls for the DBs. MASSIVE simplification of the
  aux_get code -- removed memory-caching in favor of system cache (actually
  faster in all cases so far -- P100 and P4-2.2G). Lockfile usage around the
  cachefile.
  
  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Updated
  the API a little but to have permissions set properly. A little more
  reorganization and removed the keycount checks.

  21 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: download size 
  should not be displayed when the package is nomerge with --tree.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reverted

  message without --debug. This should close #23840.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved
  timestamp check of rsync. This should close #37403.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Improved
  regeneration ld.so.cache. This should close #37858.

  (example: DEPEND="!<cat/pkg-1.0.0" in cat/pkg-1.0.0.ebuild)

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Modified cpv_expand() to check package.mask. This should close #38592.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Escaped
  regualar expression for replace entry in fixdbentries().

  18 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:

  class to have class lockfiles for the db and tmpdb dirs as well as lock
  other files before editing. Reorganization of the merge code in dblink
  so that the tmpdb is filled immediately after preinst and prior to the
  actual FS merging -- COUNTER and CONTENTS go directly into the tmpdb
  and not into the infodir.

  as it isn't used, and was deprecated for a long while. Genone's fetching
  size display added for --verbose. License display added. Added a little
  debug for IUSE so we can figure out the binary package --verbose IUSE
  issues that are randomly reported. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX's 'buildsyspkg'
  patch for building only system packages into tbz2s. Unmerge fix for new
  settings instances. RSYNC_RATELIMIT added.
  
  10 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: ADA path
  variables added to specials for env_update. Error messaeg correction for
  make.defaults syntax errors. Unmerge now uses the environment file, if it

  load_infodir() uses pkg settings completely now. Fixed the passing of
  settings in unmerge and dblink. Fixed an issue regarding unlinking lockfiles
  while inside of a sandbox.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh, *.sh:
  Moved helper scripts into bin/functions and made them sourceable -- they
  now will die in cases where sub-parts fail. dodoc and keepdir are now
  recursive-capable.

  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: emerge.log now
  set as portage:portage with 0660 perms. --debug now enables tracebacks
  for dep generation instead of moving code out of the try block.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> g-cpan.pl: rac's patch
  to get arch list from portage's list of arches in the profiles.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Moved a bit of

  in features. Fixed a potential for repoman to miss updates that should
  get a new manifest and commit. Fixed digest/manifest generation for
  non-packagedir runs of repoman.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emergehelp.py, make.conf,
  getbinpkg.py:  Message touch ups.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: load_infodir()
  uses pkg settings now instead of env and backup. Genone's custom mirror

  Refixed the invalidentry stuff that was lost across patch merges. Fix for
  pkg-keywords from genone included. Genone's deprecated profile patch for
  reporting to a user that their current profile is deprecated. Message about
  missing arch.list instead of spouting invalid keywords messages.

  08 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman:

  01 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which 
  always remakes info dir file.

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed issue with

  This closes bug #34660.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Migration
  to non-global settings started -- class config has new functionality and
  is locked after portage is finished initializing -- changes cannot be made
  to the global instance of config 'settings' -- reset() is now functional,
  setcpv() loads PKGUSE from /etc/portage/package.use, load_infodir() loads
  all small files (under 4k) from the vardb directory of an installed package
  so that operations have the same post* settings as they had at merge time.
  Begin modifications to spawn() to allow for files/pipes to be used for
  IO instead of using getstatusoutput which does not take an environment
  parameter like execve(). check_config_instance() ensures that the provided
  parameter is a 'class config' instance -- for ensuring that everything is
  being passed properly with the changes. Fix for the local FS mirror issue
  where it removed the first '/' instead of the last one. doebuild() cleanups
  for readability and pkguse enhancements -- also remove getstatusoutput()
  usage for depend so that we don't have to modify the active environment.
  Fix for symlink mtime values returned from movefile. (Nakano) SLOTMOVE
  added to global update functionality to fix some issues where a package
  suddenly must become slotted. portdbapi takes a root parameter instead
  of using settings. Slightly more useful output from depend. binarytree()
  now takes a pkgdir instead of using settings. Portage will now die if
  ebuild.sh exits on a signal.
  
  Moved some functions around and renamed them for general use -- derived
  from match2 in class portagetree:
  match_to_list() find all atoms in a list that match a given package.
  best_match_to_list() determines the most specific match. Needs work.
  match_from_list() find all packages in a list that match a given atom.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed an issue
  with searchdesc wanting root permissions if run as non-root. Migrated to
  the non-global config class. EMERGE_FROM added for the dyn_preinst patch
  -- Indicates if a merge is occuring from an ebuild or from a binary. Patch
  for rsync timestamp checking from Nakano.
  
  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Save PKGUSE.
  Pebeneto's patch for dyn_preinst and SELinux added as a fix for binary
  and ebuild merges. Added a kill for portage during the depend phase so
  that portage will actually die if you control-C.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: MASSIVE set of changes
  to start using locally defined 'class config' instances. This allows us to
  start working on some parallelism among other things. Created this way:
  mysettings = portage.config(clone=portage.settings)
  
  The Following functions now take a 'config' parameter:
  spawn(), fetch(), digestgen(), digestcheck(), spawnebuild(), doebuild(),
  merge(), dep_opconvert(), dep_check(), dblink.__init__()
  
  package.keywords is now implemented curtasy of genone/max. PKGUSE was
  rewritten for the global config killing and is also included. X11 man
  pages now found and zipped correctly. SYS.PATH fixes for the python
  migration -- issue actually only shows up on 2.2 systems because of how
  compiled modules are used if found regardless of the original source's
  existance.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> tabcheck.py: An easier
  way to make sure that all the python stuff is correctly using tabs and
  not mixing spaces.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> xpak, xpak.py: Fixes
  to ensure that it works if the current dir is missing and that the python
  path gets set properly.
  
  22 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  calls in vartree method to invalidentry().... made them call call
  self.dbapi.invalidentry() (there were multiple wrong method calls.)
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> md5check.py: Checks all
  digests and SRC_URIs for filenames and associated MD5s. Reports collisions
  between versions/packages, missing, and extra lines in digests.

*portage-2.0.49-r17/18 (10 Nov 2003): Fixes

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Changed portage to
  be the first path in sys.path for all python scripts. Also enabled
  optimizations from the scripts to ensure everything imported is built
  for speed. ebuild: applied fix for the '//' root breaking the db[].
  prepstrip: etdyn quickfix
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix for
  RESTRICT=nouserpriv. GENTOO_MIRRORS can have paths set to take files
  from. Fixes for mishandled cache data regarding *pkgsplit(). Fixes for
  '*' being returned as part of a package split. An 'invalidentry()' fix
  for a traceback. Nakano's fixes for virtual removals not working properly,
  sandbox violations during pkg_nofetch, || depend selection. Genone's
  fixpackages speedup.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: PORTAGE_TMPDIR
  fix for distcc. Variable passing bug patch for export_functions. Exit 1
  added for nofetch to stop sandbox violation. Nakano's --tree patch added.
  Improved the unmerge messages to denote what kind of unmerge fails. Info
  pages regex pattern adjusted to allow most any name for a page.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: genone's xml
  linting additions.

  01 Nov 2003; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py:
  fix bug #32071, by properly escaping a string to not be a regex. Checked
  thru entire *.py tree and found this is the only mis-use of strings that
  need to be escaped.

  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: /lib/modules
  now gets "unmerge protection." This is half of the config protection
  functionality. It means that anything in /lib/modules will not be deleted
  when a package is unmerged (often automatically when a user merges a
  kernel module ebuild for a new kernel.) This solves the "my module
  disappeared!" issue. This closes bug #1477.
  
  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: Should no longer
  spit out wacky "!!! no match found" warnings when auto-cleaning.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only run
  depscan.sh if it exists on disk. This allows Portage to run inside a stage1
  where /sbin/depscan.sh doesn't exist.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Applied fix to
  allow multi-level "use? (   )" in SRC_URI, closing bug #16159.

*portage-2.0.49-r15/16 (21 Oct 2003): Fixes

  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> fix-db.py: was broken
  for python2.3 -- fixed now.
  
  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  lockfiles to prelink md5 checks. Fixed caching bug where cache objects
  were passed back as pointers instead of copies. Added 'invalidentry'
  function to handle lockfiles -- It tests/deletes them using unlockfile.
  Added fix-db.py to the 'databases is broken' messages.

  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: added CDPATH
  to unset. SELinux fix for sandbox.
