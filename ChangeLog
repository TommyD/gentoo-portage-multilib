*portage 1.7.8 (21 Dec 2001)

  21 Dec 2001; portage.py: ebuild install doesn't throw away the compile
  directory if ebuild has been changed and MAINTAINER is set; we now use
  mv -f to move files into location on the filesystem, making our library
  install method even more robust.  It should now be totally safe to 
  upgrade glibc while in X and playing music with xmms and surfing the
  Web and compiling 20 applications at once :)

* portage 1.7.7 (14 Dec 2001)

  14 Dec 2001; Aron Griffis (agriffis@gentoo.org): portage.py: movefile() now
  unlink()s the destination file first which solves shared library install
  problems.

* portage 1.7.6 (13 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; portage.py: env_update() now generates an /etc/csh.env file
  in csh shell format.

* portage 1.7.5 (13 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; portage.py: added a little fix so a ~ dep isn't satisfied by
  a *much* later installed version; i.e. ~media-libs/freetype-1.3.1 satisfied
  by media-libs/freetype-2.0.5 being installed.
  
  30 Nov 2001; ebuild: added a KeyboardInterrupt handler so ^C'ing a running
  ebuild process doesn't produce a Python traceback.

* portage 1.7.4 (29 Nov 2001)

  29 Nov 2001; portage.py: removed an unnecessary quirk in the code preventing
  virtual packages from being in any other category but "virtual".
  
  25 Nov 2001; emerge's info file detection code has been improved.  

* portage 1.7.3 (20 Nov 2001)

  20 Nov 2001; pdb, pdb.cgi and xpak used /usr/bin/python instead of
  /usr/bin/spython.  Fixed.

* portage 1.7.2 (13 Nov 2001)

  13 Nov 2001; Aron Griffis (agriffis@gentoo.org): emake will now try to build
  in parallel, and if it fails, will retry in non-parallel mode.
  
  13 Nov 2001; ebuild.sh: an ebuild that used an archive with a name that was
  part of another archive would cause Portage to mess up the digest check.  No
  longer.

  31 Oct 2001; Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org): make.conf, make.globals:
  comments about merging the fetch programs before trying to use them.

* portage 1.7.1 (30 Oct 2001)

  30 Oct 2001; portage.py: I accidentally broke "=" deps by being sloppy when
  I added "*" deps.  Trivial fix applied.

* portage 1.7 (29 Oct 2001)

  29 Oct 2001; portage.py: strange typo fix in the empty() digraph method.

* portage 1.6.12 (29 Oct 2001)

  29 Oct 2001; portage.py: "*" deps now implemented. "=sys/foo-1*" matches the
  latest 1.x version/rev of sys/foo, but will not match a 2.x version.

  26 Oct 2001; portage.py: various new categories added.

Portage 1.6.11, released 18 Oct 2001
====================================

	*portage.py; device nodes are now not unmerged at all.


Portage 1.6.10, released 18 Oct 2001 
===================================

	*ebuild.sh: A and AA fix; now any A="foo" lines in the ebuild are ignored,
	allowing ebuilds with them to continue working.
	
	*portage.py: remove gnome-apps, gnome-office, gnome-libs, add gnome-extra
	categories.

	*ebuild.sh, portage.py: You can now use USE variables in SRC_URI to
	conditionally include archives.  In MAINTAINER mode, all archives are
	automatically included so that maintainers can check SRC_URIs and also
	generate complete digests.  A new file-based DEPEND and RDEPEND-passing
	mechanism has been added.
	
	*ebuild.sh Now adds filesize to the digest files

Portage 1.6.9, released 15 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	unmerge() now does not touch device nodes.  Unlinking them or touching them
	in any way is bad practice.


Portage 1.6.8, released 12 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	movefile() will now unlink() destfile if it is a symlink.  Should fix 
	problems where file gets created at symlink target rather than replacing
	the symlink.

	*queryhost.sh (agriffis)
	Parallel pinging and other fixes.

Portage 1.6.7, released 05 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	(last-minute fix)
	CONFIG_PROTECT unmerge protection is now observed for symlinks, fifos and
	device nodes.
	
	*portage.py
	Fixes for unmerging CONFIG_PROTECTed files.  Protected files are now *not*
	unlinked from the filesystem.  Messier but safer, and simplifies package
	upgrades.

	*emerge
	Emerge output cleanups for GNU info directory generation.  New --verbose
	mode; new CONFIG_PROTECT scanning feature to let people know when there are
	config files to be updated.  New "--help config" docs to explain how to
	do it.

Portage 1.6.6, released 01 Sep 2001
====================================

	*portage.py
	Upgraded directory merging over existing objects.  Existing symlinks that
	point to existing directories will be kept and used as is; directories will
	be used as-is; any other objects (broken symlinks, files) will be copied
	to origfilename.backup and a ne directory will be created in its place.

Portage 1.6.5, released 31 Aug 2001
====================================
	
	*emerge 
	Fixes for handling multiple ebuilds, packages and/or dependencies on
	the command-line.

	*portage.py 
	An optimization to the digraph class so that the firstzero() method finds
	matches in close to the order that keys were added to the digraph.
