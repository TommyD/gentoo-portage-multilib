# Copyright 2002 Gentoo Technologies, Inc.; Distributed under the GPL v2

  01 Feb 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Adjusted
  the arch.list code to be a general masking setup. /etc/make.profile/
  and /etc/portage/ have use.mask files that are concatenated. On fetch,
  if downloader reports failure, then check that filesize<digestfilesize
  and continue onto the next mirror before dying.

  27 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh/portage.py:
  eclass fixups for newdepend issues where newdepend operates on RDEPEND
  prior to it being set to default by ebuild.sh. Repoman fix for multi-
  arch failures by excluding /usr/portage/profiles/arch.list entries from
  consideration, excluding $ARCH.

*portage-2.0.46-r9 (14 Jan 2003): portage restart fix
  15 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed the
  missing tabs from the cvs diff backport.

*portage-2.0.46-r7 (14 Jan 2003): Backport from cvs and fixes.
  portage-2.0.46* :: EXCUDES ALL PORTIONS RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO USERPRIV

  14 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Persistant
  KV and KVERS on depend calls. Sandbox violation of do_upgrade() caught.

  14 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: --buildpkg
  touchups and forward porting of some of 2.0.46-r6. Restart on -r0/proper
  versions of portage due to VERSION not matching pkgsplit output fixed.

  14 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: 20% speedup
  in dep generation by removing all external app calls. Moved KVERS to
  portage to make it persistent during dep calls. Other code moved into
  conditionals based on $*!=depend. chmod's swaped with umask.

  11 Jan 2003; Jack Morgan <jmorgan@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf.sparc:
  updated make.conf.sparc to add CFLAGS for sparc32 and sparc64

  08 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> bin/g-cpan.pl:
  Added from bug 3450 -- Creates and merges perl module ebuilds on-the-fly
  from cpan and merges them.

  08 Jan 2003; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf.ppc:
  updated make.conf.ppc to remove G3 options for CFLAGS and other
  small tweaks

*portage-2.0.47 (06 Jan 2003): UserPriv

  06 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Forced HOME to BUILD_PREFIX regardless of user. Added in a 'rm -Rf' notice
  to readonly-fs/Full-Disk notices. Disabled the usepkg on buildpkg function
  of portage. digraph.hasallzeros() added -- Determines if tree is zero depth.
	
  06 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/*: Added in the
  PORT_LOGDIR option and description. Also added a GENTOO_MIRRORS section
  back into the make.conf* files so that users are aware that they need to
  specify ibiblio. Killed the linefeeds in the sparc conf.

  06 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: options and
  actions fixup. Added new short options and long options. --buildpkgonly
  now works and restricts the process to deplists of zero depth. Updated
  the help for portage, and created a seperate shorthelp function with
  the terse, options-only, versions of the regular help. Fixed the env_update
  call after --fetchonly runs.

  06 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  touchups to the user priv and logging code to kill the invalid user
  messages when portage:portage doesn't exist on the system.

  few minor restrictions like changing portage variables.

*portage-2.0.47_pre3 (02 Jan 2003): Forward port of fixes & New fixes

  02 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:

  -r0 removal on current ver to stop people from complaining about it.
  More info added to 'emerge info' output.

  02 Jan 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Spaces in filenames fix for prelink-capable systems. Exception caused
  by invalid or unsatisfiable '||' dependancies caught and warned about.

  Tokenizer fixup courtasy of Evgeny Roubinchtein. unalias -a in ebuild.sh.
  Moved the help() to emergehelp.py. prepallman fixup for missed symlinks.
  More info provided for portage-user-missing message. FEATURES=sandboxuser
  not provides sandbox in compile phase along with userpriv. mtimedb
  exception should actually be caught now.
	
*portage-2.0.47_pre1 (21 Dec 2002): Feature: userpriv compiles

  21 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *:
  ebuild.sh: portage user setup. dyn_setup is always run before calls to
  unpack,compile,install. emerge: infodirs cleanup, traceback on invalid
  dir fix. Proper regen on info change. portage.py: uid/gid discovery and
  check code. PRELINK_PATH and PRELINK_PATH_MASK added and renamed. Made

  color additions. Prelink code removed -- Users can do it instead.

  18 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  use_{enable,with}() work now. Rearranged auxdbkeys again.
	
  17 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Regenerate /lib/cpp and /usr/bin/cc in pkg_setup if they are not
  files to ease the broken pkg_postrm() some gcc have.

  loop over multiple files instead of just doing one.

  13 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge/portage.py:
  Added disabled prelink code. Needs a little more work. Gave portage the
  ability to restart on upgrades to the portage version. Ebuilds for prior
  versions will intentionally die on upgrade. USE=build disables it so
  bootstrap isn't affected.

*portage-2.0.45-r5 (13 Dec 2002): Feature addition: PDEPEND+fixes

  13 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge/portage.py:
	Added restart on portage upgrade code and adjusted ebuild to accomplish
	this until version matches -r5.

*portage-2.0.45-r4 (11 Dec 2002): Feature addition: PDEPEND

  11 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh/portage.py:
  Added [CDEPEND, PDEPEND, REBUILD] to auxdbkeys and updated ebuild.sh.
  Prevented autoclean on fetchonly.

*portage-2.0.45-r3 (09 Dec 2002): Touchups.

  09 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Fixed
  use_enable() and use_with() so that they actually work -- also don't
  have to specify 2nd parameter, 1st is assumed. 
	
  09 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added previous
  version/downgrade messages to --pretend. Extra message to notify of dep
  calculation failure as bad deps can exit portage without error.

  09 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Attempt
  at fixing the sandbox-crashes-missing-HOME bug. Added a try/catch around
  the virts/'del x' code to prevent tracebacks on boxes without a virtuals
  file.

  06 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed 'xfrom'
  variable-used-before-assignment message on masked ebuilds.

  06 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Disabled
  writes to DBs when sandbox is enabled.

  03 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed a

  mtimes.

*portage-2.0.45 (02 Dec 2002): More bug fixes for stable.

  02 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, output.py:
  Added several color options and functions to output.py. 'DO NOT EDIT'
  notices added to .env generated profile settings files. Touchups and
  nofetch() call for restricted fetches. Moved some file IO code for
  SLOTs into a try/catch. { mtimedb fixups. Eclass aux_get() error fix.
  aux_get() error fix via try/catch with magically-missing ebuild when
  doing stat on it. Enabled full eclass()/inherit code. Added code to
  flushmtimedb() entries by key name. } <-- aux_get() fixups. Made
  starttime into a long... time.time() is apparently overflowing int().
	
  02 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> bin/*:
  prep*: Fixed missed man pages and corrected loops to be fairly complete
  in the included files. quickpkg: Loop to do each in $@ (Peter Sharp).

  02 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Yank '++' from searches and make it '\+\+' so that it works. Reformated
  'all ebuilds are masked' message to be a little more obvious. env_update()
  AFTER autoclean... not in autoclean -- Fixes ldconfig issues. Typo fixes.

  02 Dec 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  Added has(), general use()-like function -- 'has this_thing $VAR' returns
  shell true or false. Added has_version(), portage call to determine if
  a specified DEPEND-atom is installed -- 'has_version ">=mozilla-1.2"'
  returns shell true or false. Added best_version(), portage call to
  get the best/most-recently-merged version of a DEPEND-atom statement --
  'best_version ">=mozilla-1.0"' prints a string. pkg_nofetch() displays
  SRC_URIs by default on RESTRICT -- Can be redefined to display custom
  messages. die() on unpack() failure added. Courtasy of SpanKY: Added
  use_with() and use_enable() for --with-thing and --enable-thing.
  'use_with gd libgd' would print --with-libgd if gd was in USE and
  --without-libgd if not.

  19 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> cnf/etc-update.conf:
  Add 'menu' config item and note about it needing dev-utils/dialog, as
  a lot of users do not know about this nifty feature.

  14 Nov 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> man/emerge.1:
  Cleaned up the more recent edits to the man page to more closely
  match the previous format, fix various typos, and so on.  Expanded
  the REPORTING BUGS section, and made the PACKAGE MASKING part of the
  NOTES a stand-alone section.

*portage-2.0.44 (11 Nov 2002): bug fixes and 1.2 rescue/install setup

  11 Nov 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *:
  bin/*: fixes for spaces-in-filename issues, lots of quotes added. conf/*:
  touched up comments and warning. Added RSYNC_RETRIES.	ebuild.sh: exit now
  reports the failing ebuild's $CATEGORY/$PF. Added EXTRA_ECONF to econf().
  emake: added EXTRA_EMAKE. emerge: RSYNC_RETRIES curtasy of Christopher
  Sharp. Random comment fixes. portage.py: Random touchups. KV extraction
  fixup for new ROOTs. ARCH missing in profile fix. Fix for packages/All
  missing dir traceback. INFOPATH/INFODIR fix. Added INFOPATH to specials.
  portage.py: Touchups to the mtimedb-touching code. Fixes for the broken
  os.path.normpath() leading '//' bug. Added a modified chuck of Phoen][x's
  dist size patch.

  Fix for missing-glibc-bug in --version.

  08 Nov 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fix for cfgdictfile traceback when ROOT != '/'. Fix for missing kernel
  headers -- checks usr/src/linux, then /usr/include, then if merging
  from sys-kernel ignore error.

  07 Nov 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fix (part 2) for the USE="-*" arch-missing problem.

  03 Nov 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  eclass() function uses a caching and cPickle storing method to determine
  currency of eclass-derived depcache entries. All previous methods are
  already removed. eclass_save() is called via store() now. Stripped some
  cruft from aux_get(). Error message touchups.

  03 Nov 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  A couple message touchups.

  29 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Moved the autoclean section under the --pretend check so it doesn't flip
  out when running '-f'. Preliminary support for binary-only methods.
  --usepkgonly (implies --usepkg) to force errors is binaries don't exist.

  27 Oct 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> new*: changed "&&" to "||"
  to provide even better protection against mis-use of these commands.

*portage-2.0.43 (27 Oct 2002): Bug fix release

  27 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  AUTOCLEAN="yes" on by default. Added in a clean phase after the merge
  phase so clashing library versions do not remain installed when ldconfig
  is run. This should close up the symlinks-being-removed bugs.
	
  27 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/*:
  Miscelaneous typo fixes. Added PORTDIR_OVERLAY description in make.conf.

  26 Oct 2002; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Don't act like the download failed if after successfully downloading
  a file its size doesn't match the file size in the digest.  Treat
  this as a mismatched digest condition instead.

  26 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Reversed the defaults on env_update() so it does a full ldconfig instead
  of a non-symlink ldconfig. Fixed the typo in the 'invalid conf' notices.

*portage-2.0.42 (24 Oct 2002): Bug fix release

  24 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.defaults.5:
  Removed this file. It is horribly out of date and completely
  wrong to boot. Users shouldn't be modifying the 3 lines in this file
  anyway. They are obvious if you understand conf and defaults.

  24 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Added missing return statements to select_dep() that caused unmet packages
  to be ignored. Touchups to 'emerge info' and 'emerge --version' output.
  Added --delete to --delete-after so that it actually deletes in rsync.

  24 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Warning touchups. Replaced constants (9) to index("INHERITED").

  23 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> bin/new*:
  Fix for "running as a root user" bug... code does 'rm -rf /' if
  variables aren't defined in environment... That's a bad thing.

  23 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Possible fix for the aux_get() issues and IUSE.

  22 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  noauto got lost in some weird conflicts of .38, added it back.

  22 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Primitive logging via emergelog(). countdown(N,str) function does N second
  countdowns of the action 'str'. Error messages on dependancy traceback
  via try/except on select_dep(). Removed the 'unavailable' warning. Message
  updates. Added logging of basic actions to /var/log/emerge.log. Added
  package/to-go counter. 'emerge info' displays a number of useful variables
  that is good for bug reports.

  22 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepallstrip:
  Bug 9508, fix for MSB architectures strip. Previous check assumed only
  LSB objects could/should be stripped. (*LSB -> *SB) [Joky@#gentoo-sparc]

*portage-2.0.41 (20 Oct 2002): Bug fix release

  20 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  stickies=[] lists the variables that will be kept/used as sticky vars,
  not yet implimented. Fixed several relative symlink bugs by adding
  abssymlink() to portage to determine real/absolute targets. env_update()
  modified to fix bug 9308 symlinks bug. Bug 8348, request for error messages
  instead of tracebacks/dies on parse errors, now caught on a per file basis
  for system config files, includes descriptive messages. Fix for missing
  profile traceback in new prepend'd-arch code. Typo fixes in symlink code.
  DISABLED 'KEYWORD="" == available' code, DEFAULT IS MASKED NOW. Major
  update to masking code, CONFIG_PROTECT can be layered with _MASKs, and
  update_protect() now sets the self.protect* variables. Condensed and
  reordered the unmerge code, now checks existance, cfgprotect, then mtimes.

  20 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Bug 8767: Added 'buildpkg' to FEATURES to specify always-buildpkg.
  Updated the --version output to display profile and gcc version.
  Bug 8083: Eliminate spinner when terminal is not a tty. Bug 7688:
  fixed search vs. searchdesc differences by adding 'cat/pack' split.
  Bug 9308: Symlinks were being killed by ldconfig, fixed by changing
  how/when ldconfig was allowed to set symlinks.  rsync command touchups,
  --delete-after so that a failed rsync won't leave a user
  without/with-few packages in portage.	More warnings to depclean.

  20 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  Added die to gzip in unpack()

  20 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.conf*:
  Added in useful variables and descriptions+warnings of their uses.

  20 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.globals*:
  Added in large "do not edit" message.

  16 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fixed an mtimes issue. --update on a package might yank non-cfgprot
  files during the clean-phase because they didn't have mtimes updated.

  15 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Added 'IUSE' to the auxdbkey list. Fixed random aux_get() errors
  caused by random empty files in the dep cache.

  15 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh
  Actually committed the --host portion of econf.

  15 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> portage.py, missingos.c:
  Remove testsandbox.sh, and comment code in portage.py that still
  used it to no real use.  Add another '\' to the 'missingos_mknod__doc__'
  string in src/python-missingos/missingos.c to fix failure with gcc-3.3.

*portage-2.0.40 (13 Sep 2002): Bug fix release

  15 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  emerge depclean -- Removes all packages that are not explicitly or
  dependancy merged.

  15 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  depend now prints IUSE. Doesn't do anything with it yet.
  unpack() -- unzip silently overwrites files ().
  econf() -- now specifies '--host=${CHOST}'

  15 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.globals:
  Touch ups + warning.

  15 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> etc-update:
  Make etc-update find all the same CONFIG_PROTECT files as portage
  by importing it's settings from portage.

*portage-2.0.39 (13 Sep 2002): Bug fix release

  13 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Bug 5926 -- If the fetchonly AND pretend flags are specified, then
  portage should give a list of all the SRC_URIs so that they can be
  downloaded or sent into another app. Made sandbox display name in
  'ps' as '[$PF] sandbox'.

  13 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Bug 5926 -- See portage.py for today. (emerge -pf)
  Typo fixes.

  13 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  Added -q to unzip to make it quiet like the others.
  Bug 6033 -- Fix for infinate loop in eclasses in portage overlay.

  12 Oct 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix for
  doebuild() so that our rsync mirror will contain full digests and not just
  partial digests for x86.

  12 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Added --progress to rsync. This puts the file progress meters
  back on. Users have requested this, and it's not detrimental.
  Just creates a lot of output, as the man page says: "It gives
  bored users something to look at."

  12 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Bug 6361 -- Added checking on directories to ensure that we can
  write to them before we try and traceback. Also added pieces to
  functions so that return conditions are propagated back to emerge
  so that it actually dies on errors. Message on condition details
  restart process.

  11 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make*globals:
  Removed the tomcat configs from CONFIG_PROTECT

  11 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> doman:

  Added not-an-man-page message.

  11 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dohtml:
  Bug 8208 -- Added 'js' to the include list, and added '-A' as an
  append flag. '-a' was a filter-down-to.

  11 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Bug 8964 -- Fix for read-only traceback in digestgen().
  Bug 8949 -- Fix for read-only traceback in doebuild()
  Bug 8284 -- Prepend ARCH _after_ use order processing. Prevents -*
  from killing the ARCH flag. Bug 7596 -- Set an mtime of 0 into
  CONTENTS if the file already exists on the FS. Allows the entry
  to be in the CONTENTS file. Condensed the protect/protect-mask
  code into one function in class dblink. Revised code to allow
  multi-level protects and masks.

  10 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Bug 8552 -- typo fixes

  10 Oct 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf.ppc :
  Fixed type in reccomended CFLAGS for generic ppc (was 02, corrected 
  to O2)

  09 Oct 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fixed a bug where files less than 2 characters in /etc/env.d
  weren't checked correctly, and tracebacked env_update()

  07 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  Also set $TMP, as MDK among distros sets this, and it causes
  breakage during bootstrap.  This should close bug #8101.

  07 Oct 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> man/ebuild.5 :
  Updated the man page to include missing functions in portage

  05 Oct 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf cnf/make.conf.ppc:
  Fixed typo (missing "/") in make.conf and make.conf.ppc, bug #7944

  28 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: remove
  deprecated "ld.so" from newdepend.

*portage-2.0.38 (25 Sep 2002): Bug fix release 

  25 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: now "emerge world"
  and "emerge system" don't replace packages. This closes bug #8282.
  
  21 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage-2.0.38.ebuild:
  Added additional perm check for /var/cache/edb/dep dirs and fixed perm
  settings in the ebuild's pkg_postinst(); this should close bug #7719.
  
  21 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  carpaski's patch to add PF to the sandbox's argv[0], closing bug #8141.

  19 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: tweaked emerge so
  that "--pretend" displays don't show "N" all the time.

  19 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: tweaked help to
  not list deprecated options.

  25 Sep 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> cnf/make.globals,
  cnf/make.globals.ppc: Added /opt/jakarta/tomcat/conf to CONFIG_PROTECT. Note
  by drobbins: this will be removed soon when this gets moved to an /etc/env.d
  file in the tomcat package.

*portage-2.0.37 (19 Sep 2002): Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc1 version 

  10 Sep 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf.ppc : Backed down
  CFLAGS from -O3 to -O2 on ppc as -O3 has proven to be unreliable on all
  PowerPC-based machines

  09 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: new parameterized
  create() engine, security pass fixes ("emerge" as non-root doesn't print
  "root access required" but shows help instead), emerge --pretend output fixes
  ("to /" lines are dropped and only displayed if installation root != "/".)
  New (and currently unofficial and undocumented) "--deep" and "--selective"
  options that correspond to their respective create() parameters. Using
  "--deep" will enable "deep emerging" -- updating all deps even if the parent
  doesn't need updating. The new parametrized create() is also much cleaner
  than the previous incarnation.
  
  09 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: os.chdir() ->
  chdir() fix, enhanced fetch() digest corruption handling.

  06 Sep 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> cnf/make.globals.ppc :
  Updated make.globals.ppc to reflect new CFLAGS for 1.4 release

*portage-2.0.36 (04 Sep 2002): Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc1 version 

  04 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: "--onlydeps" was
  mostly broken since the most recent emerge code restructure. Now fixed,
  closing bug #7442.
  
  04 Sep 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> etc-update.conf: added
  missing etc-update config file.
  
  04 Sep 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: removed error
  detection based on return value for pkg_preinst() and friends when called
  from merge() and unmerge(), since the value can be unreliable due to the &&
  shell construct, depmod -a returning a non-zero value, etc. Also fixed
  env_update() to treat CONFIG_PROTECT and CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK correctly.

*portage-2.0.35 (03 Sep 2002) 

  03 Sep 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> etc-update,
  man/etc-update.1: new program for updating config files.
  
  03 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: upgraded
  inherit() to support $PORTDIR_OVERLAY, closing bug #6033.
  
  03 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: calls to "cvs" now
  use "-z3" compression option, closing bug #5982.
  
  03 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: symlinks to
  .tbz2's in the $PKGDIR/All directory (from $PKGDIR/$CATEGORY) are now
  relative, closing bug #6881.

  03 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: einstall now
  sees "GNUmakefile", closing bug #4895.
  
  03 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: typo fixes,
  closing bug #7263.

  03 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: /var/tmp
  creation now works even if /tmp already exists, closing bug #7376.
  
  02 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed a logic error
  that resulted in non-root emerge failure. This closes bug #7389.

*portage-2.0.34 (01 Sep 2002) 

  01 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py, ebuild.sh:
  Azarah's ebuildsh() removed, various other little fixes like pkg_preinst and
  friends not dying on non-zero return codes.
  
  01 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: add a custom
  version of the esyslog() function to fix the "Red Star" bug if no logger is
  running.

*portage-2.0.33_p1 (30 Aug 2002): urgent fix

  31 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: comment out the if
  clause that only executed inherit() conditional on $PORTAGE_RESTORE_ENV. It
  didn't work and broke portage 2.0.33 as far as inheriting ebuilds goes.

*portage-2.0.33 (30 Aug 2002) 

  30 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : some additional clean-ups
  for the make.conf(.ppc) files.
  
  30 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: emerge search would
  die when aux_get() raised a KeyError; we now catch and handle this exception.
  This closes bug #7280.
  
  29 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed typo in
  move_ent() code that messed up moving packages into previously non-existant
  category directories in /var/db/pkg.
  
  30 Aug 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf.ppc : Updated
  cnf/make.conf.ppc with new CFLAGS for 1.4 release

*portage-2.0.32 (29 Aug 2002)  
  
  29 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: favorites weren't
  working since 2.0.30; they're working again now. This closes bug #7225.

  29 Aug 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Added a small
  blurb regarding what to do when emerge --update [world|system] fails because
  of new features such as || and ?.  Hopefully this will assuage the fairly
  common questions regarding this.

*portage-2.0.31 (29 Aug 2002)

  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed a config
  file protection logic bug detected and identified by Azarah. It basically
  broke most config file updates and has been broken for around six months.
  Very surprised no one had encountered this issue before.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: improved error
  messages when an unsatisfiable dependency is encountered. Now lets you know
  if there are masked packages that would satisfy the dep.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: emerging .tbz2
  packages and .ebuilds by name now works; this was broken in 2.0.30.

*portage-2.0.30 (28 Aug 2002)

  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: rewrote
  gettimeval() as cpv_counter() and updated it to handle corrupt COUNTER files,
  closing bug #6763.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: "emerge search" now
  displays information for masked packages if possible, closing bug #6823.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed an old gbevin
  bug where "emerge search" wouldn't show packages whose version string was
  only one character long, ie. "foo-3". This closes bug #6800.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: added a missing
  call to flatten() in dep_check(), allowing recursive sublists in dependencies
  and SRC_URI variables to work; this closes bugs #7104, #7116, #7122.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> doman: fixed some typos,
  closing bug #7152.
  
  28 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: major
  work to emerge: reworked the internal code organization to make depgraph code
  easier to understand; unified two code paths so that ebuild/.tbz2 choices
  when "--usepkg" should now be eternally consistent; tweaked portage.py so
  that dep_expand()'s dbapi argument is optional. In the process of all this,
  isolated and fixed bug #4508.
  
  27 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> portage.py: if the dep
  cache is stale, it is possible that aux_get() will call doebuild(depend) to
  regenerate it again.  This call will cause $T to be set to "", which will
  break anything that needs $T to be set to a writable location inside the
  sandbox, so we need to set $T to a valid value again.

  27 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: improved error
  handling/detection of bad pkgsplit() and catpkgsplit() calls; should close
  bug #6803, #6853.
  
  26 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fix so that "emerge
  prune rsync" doesn't complain that you are trying to rsync and prune at the
  same time. This closes bug #6785.
  
  26 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> doman fixes; should work
  for pre-gzipped man-pages and man-pages with multiple "."s in their name.
  Closes bugs #6770, #6917
  
  25 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed an
  indentation problem of the 'else:' at line 1304. 

  20 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: removed stray
  "DEBUG:" output, closing bug #6732.

*portage-2.0.29 (18 Aug 2002)

  18 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py,
  ebuild.sh: making some effort to make output cleaner and less cluttered,
  particularly with error handling.
  
  18 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: updated so that
  "emerge --inject foo-1.0" fails instead of injecting "null/foo-1.0"; fixed
  error in help; "emerge --inject" and "emerge" with no specified files or
  package classes prints out a small warning and exits. Closes bug #6353.
  
  18 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: movefile()
  didn't like bind mounts due to a peculiar quality -- according to their
  ST_DEV stat() information, they are on the same filesystem, so rename()
  should work, but it doesn't. We now fall back to copy if rename() doesn't
  work. Closes bug #6468.
  
  18 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: made significant
  enhancements and fixes to ebuild.sh's error-handling code. Errors in
  src_unpack(), src_compile(), src_install() and others should now be correctly
  detected. Also downgraded our use() function since we are not implementing
  extended USE functionality. Closes bug #6393.
  
  18 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: portdb's
  cp_all() now skips "CVS" directories, closing bug #6662. 
 
  18 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: aux_get():
  exception handler to print informative message when encountering wacky cache
  entries that we just can't fix (for some reason.)
 
  17 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: removed
  deprecated "ld.so" dependency from Dan Armak's newdepend() function.
  
  17 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: doebuild()
  running in "depend" mode will set $T to "" to prevent a parent's $T from
  being inherited; this is important when we run custom portage code from
  inside an ebuild (such as pkg_postinst)... it allows dep caching to not
  break. Closes bug #6484.

*portage-2.0.28 (17 Aug 2002)

  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: return errors when
  two actions like "world" and "system" are specified on the command-line, or
  when "system" or "world" are combined with package names. Closes bug #6492.
  
  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: bad string was
  causing pkg_prerm() and pkg_postrm() to not be called; now fixed.  This
  closes bug #6493.
  
  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: now calls
  env-update() after an unmerge() run (to fix library paths, links, etc.)
  Closes bug #6511.
  
  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> doman: now handles already-
  gzipped man pages correctly, closing bug #6544.
  
  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed a bug where a
  dep specified on the command-line with --usepkg would use an old package if
  it happened to match the dep. Now, it will use the ebuild instead, just like
  how deps of deps are treated.

*portage-2.0.27 (06 Aug 2002)

  07 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: removed some
  beta extended USE functionality to speed up regenerate(); as we are likely
  not going to need extended USE for a good while.
  
  07 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: ebuild.sh now
  supports "config" (pkg_config) again.

  06 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: change debug-print()
  to exit if $T is not defined, i.e. if emerge is running in dependency
  detection mode and isn't actually emerging everything. This fixes bug #4932
  (the "eclass-debug.log is created in /" problem).

  06 Aug 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Fixed a
  case-check problem that prevented tar.Z from being un-tar'd. This closes bug
  #6126.

  06 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> portage.py, ebuild.sh:
  Remove "setup" from 'sandboxactive' in portage.py, as we are not running
  pkg_setup() in a sandbox anymore.  Move the restoring of the old env code
  to be the first thing in ebuild.sh, just to ensure we dont mess anything
  up when greping/awking during saving it.

*portage-2.0.26 (06 Aug 2002)

  06 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: on unmerge,
  entries are now removed from the world file if 1) the dependency refers to
  the cat/pkg being unmerged, and 2) the dependency matches the current version
  being unmerged, and 3) unmerging this package will leave no other packages on
  this system that will match this world entry.  This closes bug #3409.
  
  06 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: new global
  update support.  You can now add an entry to a file in
  /usr/portage/profiles/updates/, something like "move x11-base/xfree
  x11-base/xfree86".  Portage will then update the /var/db/pkg db on user's
  boxes so that any xfree packages are renamed to xfree86; it will also update
  the world and virtuals files appropriately.  We are naming the update files
  "3Q-2002", etc.  -- for third quarter in 2002.  This way, we don't bog
  Portage down by having it run through all our directives.  It will only look
  at update files whose mtimes have changed.  Closes bug #4753, #5463, 
  
  06 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: tweaked Azarah's
  environment-saving patch to not be enabled when $T is not defined -- this
  closes bug #6070 and should speed up dep calculations too.  Also tweaked
  ebuild.sh so that pkg_setup() is run *outside* of the sandbox.  This is
  important because piping stuff around tends to require temp files to be
  created; pkg_setup() being in the sandbox prevents this from happening.
  
  06 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh : Unset
  esave_ebuild_env in esave_ebuild_env(), otherwise the sourced copy messes
  saving of the environment.
  
  05 Aug 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Updated the man
  page to match the current version of 2.0.25.
  
  05 Aug 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Updated the man
  page to match the current version of 2.0.25.

*portage-2.0.25 (05 Aug 2002)

  05 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> src/sandbox/Makefile:
  removed -march=i386 added in Azarah's patch; breaks things for PPC, Sparc.
  
  05 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: logic error fix for
  description searching, closing bug #6031.

*portage-2.0.24 (04 Aug 2002)

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> output.py, emerge: rewrote
  our output.py module (it was weird) and tweaked emerge so that colorization
  will be disabled if NOCOLOR is set to "yes" or "true" *or* if sys.stdout isn't
  a tty.  This means that if you pipe things to "less", colorization will get
  automatically disabled.  Yay!  This closes bug #5714, 
  
  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: default
  src_compile now properly uses "die" instead of "return 1."  This closes bug
  #2981.
  
  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: "=foo/bar-1.0*"
  now matches "foo/bar-1.0_{alpha|beta|pre|rc}{int}" but not
  "foo/bar-1.1_{alpha_beta_pre_rc}{int}".  This closes bug #5874; gcc-3.2_pre
  is now considered a "3.2" rather than a very late "3.1" when doing "*"
  matching.
  
  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Applied
  carpaski's patch to allow "unpack" to also handle regular .gz or .bz2 files;
  in which case the unpacked files are placed directly in ${WORKDIR}.  Closing
  bug #5867.

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: tweaked
  exithandler() to only do its sandbox clean-up if we happen to be the root
  user.  Closes bug #5859.

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: search now lists
  masked packages correctly.  Closes bug #5854 (pending QA verification.)
  
  04 Aug 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@lsu.edu> emerge.1: The emerge man page
  now reflects the fact that emerge sync|rsync always does a --clean now.  Also
  bumped the release number to 2.0.23.

  03 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge.sh,
  sandbox.c libsandbox.c: Updated sandbox.c and libsandbox.c to use an internal
  env variable, $SANDBOX_ACTIVE to determine if sandbox should really be active
  or not.  With it only checking $SANDBOX_ON, some instances NOT running in a
  sandbox, but that set SANDBOX_ON while an actual sandbox was running, caused
  the sandbox to activate for this process.  Added in support for a more phased
  calls to ebuild.sh again.  This is this time done with support to save the
  current environment of ebuild.sh to the next call that should handle problems
  with pkg_setup() setting env variables.  Closes bugs #5853, #5817, #5950.

*portage-2.0.23 (01 Aug 2002)

  01 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  ${ROOT}var/cache/edb and friends will get created if they don't exist,
  closing bug #5813.
  
  01 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: rewrote the emerge
  search code, making it fully API-compliant and much more streamlined and
  compact.  This rewrite should fix the problem where emerge search doesn't
  support Portage overlays (bug #5783.)
  
  31 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Documented the
  fact that emerge clean does not remove unslotted ebuilds.  Bumped the man
  page revision number to 2.0.22.

*portage-2.0.22 (29 Jul 2002)

  29 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fetch() didn't
  handle resuming downloads properly when the first attempt aborted
  prematurely.  The fall back to the alternate location would not resume the
  download.  This should now be fixed.  Closes bug #5655.
  
  29 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, ebuild.sh: I
  had some code in spawn() from one of Azarah's patches that I forgot to
  remove; it caused the sandbox to be disabled all the time.  I removed this
  code, and then I tweaked ebuild.sh so that the sandbox runs in a "deny by
  default" configuration.  Before, you could add lines to the main ebuild
  (outside of a function) and it would bypass the sandbox; no more.  Closes
  bugs #5740, #5744.
  
  29 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: --help and
  --version now work for non-root users as they should.  --clean has been
  deprecated.  This closes bug #5658.

*portage-2.0.21 (28 Jul 2002)

  28 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: Added
  beta "Portage tree overlay" support.  By setting PORTDIR_OVERLAY to point to
  a local directory tree, you can cause Portage to look for ebuilds in
  PORTDIR_OVERLAY first before consulting the regular PORTDIR.  Using this
  feature, it's possible to have your PORTDIR set up to rsync but still be able
  to have locally-created ebuilds in your PORTDIR_OVERLAY tree.  For example,
  you would place your ebuild in PORTDIR_OVERLAY/sys-apps/foo/.
  
  27 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: another
  dep_opconvert() USE-handling bug-fix.  Working OK for Azarah now.
  
  27 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: small logic
  error fix in dep_opconvert() to fix up USE handling.

  27 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: security modes now
  work correctly; root access now required for merging.  The new security pass
  code was missing a check that is now present.

*portage-2.0.20 (27 Jul 2002)

  27 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge,
  repoman: Rewrote a good deal of our dependency-checking code, including all
  of dep_opconvert().  Results?  repoman will now auto-enable all USE variables
  (even ! use variables will get enabled) resulting in thorough checks of all
  specified dependencies.  DEPEND="foo? bar : oni" and DEPEND="foo? ( bar oni )
  : ( meep barf )" now works correctly.  DEPEND="|| ( foo bar oni )" now works
  correctly and will try to satisfy "foo" (the first package) if none are
  installed.  DEPEND="!foo? ( bar )" now works correctly; it was not working
  before.  This should generally mean that our dependency system is now working
  as expected.
  
  27 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: changed
  counter_tick() method so that bulk of code is in the counter_tick_code()
  helper function; then created a new method for fakedbapi that calls
  counter_tick().  This fixes "--emptytree" issues with emerge, since emerge
  still expects counter_tick() to exist as a method.

  27 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: removed
  a DEBUG: print and a stray "raise IndexError" that I used for debugging.

*portage-2.0.19 (26 Jul 2002)

  26 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Portage is now
  eclass-friendly when it comes to regenerating cache entries.  This closes bug
  #4843.
  
  26 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: Closed
  bug #5524.  Packages "emerge inject"ed will no longer get auto-cleaned
  indiscriminantly.  Injected packages now have an official COUNTER so that
  emerge clean doesn't get confused and schedule the package for removal.  Also
  modularized and improved the counter-handling functions and changed the
  counter update method so that systems with XFS filesystems that die
  unexpectedly will no longer get corrupted COUNTER files.  This should solve
  the an entire class of "my counter is corrupt" issues for XFS users.

  26 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: added exception
  handler to getcontents() so that it will gracefully ignore (with a warning)
  corrupt CONTENTS file lines.  This closes bug #5464.
  
  26 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed a single-line
  indentation error that resulted in "emerge clean" ignoring some files.  This
  closes bug #5597,#4364.
  
  25 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: --noreplace is now
  off by default and works again; --onlydeps appears to be working again; and
  merge() will merge things as specified in display(), which was not the case
  before (I rolled 2.0.18 before fixing a few things I forgot about)

*portage-2.0.18 (25 Jul 2002)

  25 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Close bug
  #5580; pkg_setup() now gets called during all build-related stages.
  
  24 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: rewrote
  create() function, closing bug #5469.  Also added freeze() and melt() methods
  to portdbapi to enhance performance.  create() is now extensively commented
  and even understandable.
  
  24 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: the "rsync --clean"
  option has been deprecated.  Cleaning is now on by default, closing bug
  #5527.

  24 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, make.globals:
  It should now be safe to do what Spider did in the gconf ebuild and add
  CONFIG_PROTECT and CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK to /etc/env.d entries.  Both variables
  are now incremental, just like USE, and you can use "-path" to turn a path
  off, or add CONFIG_PROTECT{_MASK}="path" to *add* a path to the list (this
  will not overwrite "parent" settings.  Also added "/etc/env.d/" to
  CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK in /etc/make.globals.  Also, very importantly, /etc/env.d
  is now hard-coded into CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK as it was in earlier versions of
  Portage and cannot be removed.
  
  24 Jul 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py: two
  fixes; first, I removed xcache.p support from portage.py.  The code was
  designed based on the false theory that directory mtimes are updated whenever
  an object inside that directory is modified.  That is not the case -- it
  happens when the directory listing itself changes.  Also fixed overly verbose
  emerge merging error.
  
  23 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Updated the man
  page to match some changes in the latest version of portage, along with some
  fixes recommended by drobbins.

*portage-2.0.17 (23 Jul 2002)

  23 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed a bug
  pointed out by trance -- dep_nomatch() was still using the old (deleted)
  match() function.  Now it's using a new match() method.

*portage-2.0.16 (22 Jul 2002)

  22 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: changed xcache
  behavior so that the cache gets totally thrown away when the masks are
  updated.  Also revamped carpaski's code so we can avoid loading xcache from
  disk if we simply plan to throw it away.  This necessitated the creation of a
  new file in /var/cache/edb: mtimes.  This file stores mtimes for various
  important filesystem objects.  Also added support to not regenerate the GNU
  info directory index if the mtime on /usr/share/info has not changed since
  previous invocation.

  22 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: moved
  security handling code from emerge to portage.py; also moved group "wheel"
  check to portage.py.  Added additional security checks and permissions fixes
  to the cache handling functions.

  22 Jul 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed a bug
  reported by woodchip related to merging packages.  When using --usepkg, a
  package wouldn't be used if there was a newer unmasked version of the ebuild
  available, even if the package in question was the right selection.
  
  22 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed create() code
  and consolidated some functions.  My goal is to simplify the emerge code
  until it's clean, at which point we can begin adding new features to emerge
  like more SLOT-friendly decision making.

  22 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: was able to
  remove 130 or so lines of code by depreciating the match() function (replaced
  by the match2() method.) I also rennovated the binarytree code to take
  advantage of fakedbapi.

  22 Jul 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: added the
  xcache.p fix and updated the version to 2.0.16pre (from 2.0.12) -- Also added
  in a try/except inside the store() (atexit) for xcache.p to give hints
  instead of tracebacks.

  22 Jul 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: added the
  description searching code and added a spinner to the search.

  21 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Finished the
  rewrite of the emerge man page.
    
  21 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge: Readded the sync
  help to the list of help options now that emerge --help sync works again.

*portage-2.0.15 (16 Jul 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emake: no longer falls back
  to plain old "make" if parallel make fails.  I believe it's best to fix the
  problem (turn parallel make off in the ebuild) rather than tweak emake to
  avoid it.
  
  15 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: rewrote some code,
  cleaning things up and removing redundant functions.  Starting to
  de-cruftify.

  15 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fix for permissions
  when updating the cache using server-generated entries.

*portage-2.0.14 (15 Jul 2002)
  
  15 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: ccache bug fix;
  removed extra "!".  Ccache should now get enabled properly.  Also, INHERITED
  variable is now getting added to the dep cache entries for future
  eclass-friendly caching.
  
  15 Jul 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Portage now
  *persistently* caches xmatch() calculations.  This appears to speed things up
  but we will need to limit the size of the new xcache.p in future versions of
  Portage.

  15 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: Portage
  now has keyword-based masking enabled.  It also has server-side caching
  enabled to eliminate "emerge pre-Calculating dependencies... delay" for
  end-users.  There is now an undocumented "regen" option for emerge that tells
  Portage to ensure that all entries in /var/cache/edb/dep are up-to-date.
  This is intended mainly for developers, as the server-side caching feature
  should ensure that all dep cache entries are up-to-date for end-users.

  15 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> repoman: repoman now checks
  for ebuilds that generate output as well as ebuilds that return a non-zero
  error code when sourced.  For this test to detect all failures, you need to
  wipe out your /var/cache/edb/dep/* before running repoman.  This design quirk
  is necessary to preserve existing emerge behavior.

  13 Jul 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Removed
  Azarah's ebuildsh() function as it breaks pkg_setup() again.  pkg_setup()
  needs to be called as part of the same process as any other ebuil.sh command
  so that environment vars set in pkg_setup() are preserved through the rest of
  the build process.
  
  13 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: changed calling
  convention for doebuild("depend").

  13 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: removed
  erroneous "local dbkeys" that was outside of a function.  This fixes some
  cache update problems.  Added INHERIT to our cache entries so we can
  correctly update the cache for eclass ebuilds.
  
  12 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> make.globals, make.globals.ppc:
  remove default KDE2DIR, KDE3DIR settings and comments. The kde eclasses will
  now handle the case where they are not defined. This will be used with kde
  3.1 and later, and the difference between their default value and them not
  being defined is important.

*portage-2.0.13 (11 Jul 2002)

  11 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> tarball.sh: our tarball
  script didn't clean the src/sandbox directory before creating our distribution
  tarball. This resulted in src/sandbox/sandbox (the executable) being distributed,
  and the "make" in the ebuild thinking everything was up-to-date.  The result?
  Everyone in the world got a sandbox compiled with gcc 3.1.  This has been
  fixed, closing bug #4867, #4851.
  
  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: removed some
  bogus code that snuck in.  pkg_setup() is no longer called when installing a
  tbz2.  All tbz2 stuff should be done in pkg_pre/postinst().

*portage-2.0.12 (10 Jul 2002)

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ccache support is now
  controlled via a "ccache" FEATURES variable, which is enabled in make.globals
  my default.  ccache support can now be turned off by adding a
  FEATURES="-ccache" to /etc/make.conf.  Also, CCACHE_DIR correctly detected
  and utilized.

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: "emerge --help
  rsync" now works correctly and displays rync help rather than rsyncing.  This
  closes bug #4438, #4629.

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Portage now
  prints a friendly error if PORTAGE_TMPDIR doesn't exist or is not a
  directory.  This effectively closes bug #4360.

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: the "inject",
  "sync" and "rsync" actions no longer allow "--pretend" or "-p" to be
  specified. This closes bug #4352.
  
  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> sandbox.c: use realpath()
  to expand the PORTAGE_TMPDIR, /var/tmp, /tmp paths.  This allows write access
  to these directories even if /var or /var/tmp is a symlink, for example.
  Without this fix, access to these directories will be denied by the sandbox,
  creating a bunch of problems.  Closes bugs #4256, #2379, #4625, #2931, #4829.

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> megadigest, megadownload,
  megatouch, pkgsearch: removed from the bin/ directory; deprecated.

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge, quickpkg: remove
  hard-coded references to "/usr/portage" in "emerge search", quickpkg.  Now
  correctly uses PORTDIR instead.  Closes bug #4836.

  10 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: emerge now checks
  to see if the "wheel" group exists before running; if it doesn't, it exits
  with a polite error message.  Closes bug #4736.
  
  08 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: changed the
  unmerge() code so that it doesn't use mtimes to test whether a symlink
  should be unmerged, since mtimes and symlinks are weird partners.  Instead,
  we save unmerging of our symlinks until the end of the code, and unmerge
  them only if their target no longer exists.  This closes bug #4491.
  
  08 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: check whether
  ebuild actually exists immediately before running pkg_postint() and
  pkg_preinst() from the dblink merge() method.  Also change all PKG_TMPDIR
  references to PORTAGE_TMPDIR plus suffix, closing bug #4447, #4853.

*portage-2.0.11 (07 Jul 2002)

  07 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: rewrote
  portdbapi's xmatch() and visible() to fix significant bugs.  Logic errors in
  both methods caused ~ deps to not work correctly.  After the rewrite,
  dependency checking is now 44% faster.

  07 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> repoman, portage.py: Added
  new DEPEND and RDEPEND.badmasked categories to repoman.  repoman now checks
  dependencies of masked packages using *all* ebuilds, rather than trying to
  match them against all visible ebuilds.  DEPEND.bad and RDEPEND.bad (used to
  be ".unsolvable") now only tally visible ebuilds, not masked ones.

*portage-2.0.10 (06 Jul 2002)

  05 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, repoman: Added
  new capabilities to repoman -- the ability to detect unsolvable DEPEND and
  RDEPEND variables, missing DESCRIPTION, LICENSE, KEYWORDS and SLOT.  Fixed
  repoman so that adding a comment with quotes in it doesn't break things.
  Added a few tiny extensions to portage.py to support the new repoman
  features.
  
  03 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: some ebuilds
  like gcc do not use $S to build the package in, and this causes generated .la
  files (libtool) to contain $WORKDIR in them.  We thus export $WORKDIR in
  ebuild.sh as well, to go along with fixes to the libtool-portage patch.

  02 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: pkg_setup() now
  gets called before a tbz2 is installed, and pkg_preinst() and postinst() get
  called at the right times as well.
  
  01 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> emerge: "emerge --help
  rsync" does an rsync instead of printing help.  Until this is fixed, I
  removed it from the list of detailed help options.

*portage-2.0.9 (01 Jul 2002)

  01 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> Added missing .match()
  method to portdbapi.
  
  01 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added new
  operator for dependencies: DEPEND="foo? bar : oni" will use oni if foo isn't
  set.  Added "||" support back after removing it from my working copy; looks
  ok.
  
  29 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, make.globals,
  make.globals.ppc: internalized definitions of BUILDDIR and PKG_TMPDIR in
  order to make things work as expected when one sets PORTAGE_TMPDIR.  The new
  config file var expansion algorithm made this change necessary.
  
  29 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix doebuild()
  so that pkg_setup() gets called when a .tbz2 package is being built.  This
  closes bug #3673.
  
  29 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: tweaked the
  aux_get() code to automatically regenerate cache files if they have the
  incorrect number of entries.  Added an additional fix to this code on 01 Jul
  2002.
  
  29 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> portage.py: merge in some
  of the missing ld.so.preload fixes again.

  29 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: new version
  with highly-optimized dependency calculation caching, particularly for
  portdbapi.  Includes new three-level caching portdbapi xmatch() method.
 
  27 Jun 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added keepdir()
  function so that it no longer has to be hardcoded in ebuilds.

*portage-2.0.8 (27 Jun 2002)
 
  27 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: in an attempt to
  provide a predictable release of Portage, I'm reverting the "emerge
  --pretend" "fix" in Portage-2.0.6.  It ignores custom USE settings when
  calculating child deps, which makes things tricky for users.  We'll use the
  "expected" (old) behavior for now until we have a solution for this USE
  issue.
  
  27 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed handling
  of ! deps in match(), closing bug #4219.  Thanks Spidler!

  27 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: disabled USE
  regeneration on reset() for performance purposes.

*portage-2.0.7 (26 Jun 2002)

  26 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: add a friendly
  error handler for aux_get() so that flaky ebuilds don't cause it to trip up
  with a cryptic traceback; users will get a friendly error message instead.
  Also, temporarily disable keyword-based masking, since it currently slows
  down Portage by quite a bit since it causes a much greater set of ebuilds to
  be cached.

*portage-2.0.6 (25 Jun 2002)

  25 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: rewrote the
  config file code to make things more sane, consistent, and made infinite
  loops during variable expansion a thing of the past.  This closes bug #3952.
  
  25 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py,
  ebuild.sh: "emerge --pretend" and "emerge search" now work for the root user
  as well as any users in the "wheel" group.  emerge will now gracefully exit
  if "emerge search" is run by someone not in the "wheel" group.  This closes
  bug #4121.
  
  25 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> bin/{dolib.so,preplib.so}:
  Also change "strip --strip-unneeded" to "strip --strip-debug" for these.
  Look at bugs #2702,#3929,#4027 for more info.

  25 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: "emerge -u" now
  correctly scans dependencies of packages, even if they are up-to-date, to
  determine if any of their dependencies need updating.  Previously, up-to-date
  packages were not scanned in this way, which was a bug.
  
  24 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Portage will now
  automatically take advantage of ccache if the >=dev-util/ccache-1.9 ebuild is
  installed.  Removing /var/cache/ccache hole in the sandbox.

*portage-2.0.5 (24 Jun 2002)

  23 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: basic keyword-
  based masking is now active.  New support for KEYWORDS in ebuilds and
  ACCEPT_KEYWORDS in profiles.

  23 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> conf files: removed
  references to non-functional FTP_PROXY and HTTP_PROXY and added a note about
  how to use the correct vars (ftp_proxy and http_proxy.)  Closes bug #1664.
  Also added note about RSYNC_PROXY, closing bug #2332.

  23 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: removed
  "dependency too short" checks which weren't working and were causing deps
  like "mc" and "ed" to be rejected as invalid rather than being expanded.

  23 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: upgraded "clean"
  code to be more robust, consistent. Closes bug #3967.

*portage-2.0.4 (20 Jun 2002)

  20 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> in the 2.0.4 ebuild itself:
  added back tbz2tool symlink which was mistakenly removed.  Also changed the
  way we compile portage.py stuff so that we remove the previously compiled
  files, just in case clock skew cause them to seem more recent than they
  really are.  Python byte-code compilation moved to pkg_postinst()

  20 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed up the
  fetch() code so that invalid digests don't cause a traceback.

  20 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: some of the new
  transplanted virtuals code assumed that profiledir was set, which is not 
  required.  This code has now been fixed to not make that assumption.

*portage-2.0.3 (20 Jun 2002)

  20 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed two typos
  pointed out by stroke and g2boojum.  These fix unmerge and some aspect of
  virtuals handling, which was previously causing a traceback.
  
  19 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: emerge -eup world
  now will ignore world entries if it isn't really installed locally; in 2.0.1,
  --emptytree would auto-enable all world entries, leading to inconsistent
  package lists between --emptytree and without.

*portage-2.0.2 (19 Jun 2002)

  19 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.conf.ppc,
  make.globals.ppc: integrated these files into our sources.
  
  19 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed a bug
  where ROOT="" would not get properly converted to ROOT="/".
  
  18 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: Portage 2.0+ has
  fixed "!" depend matching support, but some code in emerge was designed to
  anticipate the incorrect behavior.  This emerge code has been fixed to work
  correctly.  This closes my part of bug #3834.
  
  18 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: fixed
  bug #2444, where emerge fails when "--emptytree" and "--onlydeps" are used at
  the same time.
  
  18 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: new
  fakedbapi for doing emptytree calculations; emptytree upgrades in emerge.
  "emerge -upe world" now works correctly, accounting for items in the world
  profile.  Yay!  Bugs #3832 and #1911 fixed.
  
  18 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  Integrated new aux_get() method into our portdbapi.  aux_get() provides a
  standardized way to get cached information about ebuilds, and is now fully
  integrated into Portage and emerge search.

  18 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed a bug
  where dep_nomatch() was testing for None rather than a "zero" condition,
  causing dep_nomatch() to choke on match()'s [] return value.
  
  17 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: added an exception
  handler to catch invalid regular expressions and avoid a traceback.
  
  17 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> sandbox.c: added
  /var/cache/ccache to sandbox "write ok" list, closing bug #3028.

*portage-2.0.1 (16 Jun 2002)

  16 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: fixed a
  virtuals expansion bug that would cause virtuals to be consulted too early.

*portage-2.0 (16 Jun 2002)

  16 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, ebuild.sh,
  emerge: turbo-ified Portage, new Portage db API and many other fixes.
  Unmerging now works again (bug introduced several releases ago.)  I
  originally wanted to hold off on releasing 2.0, but since several major bugs
  are fixed, we need to get these fixes out to our users ASAP.  We will be
  releasing 2.1 in about a week which should include additional refinements.

  16 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> repoman: New repoman
  commit/check QA tool for developers.

  10 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> make.conf: Update the ibiblio
  mirror path; it is now www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo.

  10 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh : Some users have
  $TMPDIR to a custom dir in their home ...this will cause sandbox errors with
  some ./configure scripts or libtool, so set it to $T.

  10 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> portage.py : Merge in the
  ld.so.preload changes.  Also updated spawn() to only run sandbox if
  buildphase is one of clean, unpack, compile or install. This should fix the
  handler not detecting some instances of sandbox running.  Updated ebuildsh()
  to set buildphase="" on spawn exit.

  10 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>
  portage.py.ldsopreload,testsandbox.sh : Add support to test if another
  sandbox is running, if so dont delete /etc/ld.so.preload on kill.  I did not
  commit this to portage.py, as it is a bit more changes than we originally
  though.

  05 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: doebuild() now
  has proper logic for digest generation.  Digest will now get regenerated if
  "ebuild digest" is run, even if "digest" is in FEATURES.
  
  04 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed typo in
  "inject" documentation.
  
  02 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> bin/dosym: changed the
  command used from "ln -sf" to "ln -snf" as it created a symlink in the target
  directory if the linkname already existed (only if the target is a
  directory).  Im guessing this should be fixed in the python merged code if
  symlinks are not unlinked before the new is merged into place .. will add a
  bug later.

*portage-1.9.14 (01 Jun 2002)

  01 Jun 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: when a file to
  be merged is identical to the one currently on disk (using the md5 test), we
  now at least correctly update the target's mtime and atime so that cleaning
  will work correctly.
  
  27 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> bin/do*: changed "return"s
  to "exit 1".  Closes bug #3078.

*portage-1.9.13 (21 May 2002)

  21 May 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Updated man page.
  Thanks to carpaski@twobit.net.  

  20 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: a fix for dep
  regeneration; stale dep cache entries should now be properly regenerated.

*portage-1.9.12 (16 May 2002)

  16 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: the settings
  for A and AA were swapped; this has now been fixed, closing bug #1634.
  
  15 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed up some
  quirks in the new fetch code which were reported by Wout Mertens.  Thanks
  Wout!

*portage-1.9.11 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: addition of 
  third-party mirroring code.  "mirror://sourceforge/foo.tar.gz" will use the
  /usr/portage/profiles/thirdpartymirrors file to define the mirror it will
  download from.  Multiple mirrors for a single keyword can be specified on a
  single line.  This code was based on the good work of Ryan Phillips.
  
  13 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: (entry on behalf
  of jnelson) -- we now have new KV detection/setting code that uses
  /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h to determine the kernel version -- the
  right way of doing things.  KV is set to "" if the kernel is not available or
  not configured.
  
  13 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: "abspath[x]" =>
  "abspath(x)" typo fix.  Also added 2-liner to allow for "emerge unmerge" to
  specify "foo/bar-1.0" rather than requiring "=foo/bar-1.0."  Also fixed
  problems when specifying the names of actual ebuilds in /var/db/pkg to
  unmerge.
  
*portage-1.9.9 (06 May 2002) ??

  08 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: An empty
  USE_ORDER (due to an out-of-date /etc/make.globals) would cause USE to always
  be empty.  I added a reasonable default USE_ORDER if USE_ORDER is not found
  in any of the config files, fixing this problem.
  
  06 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: post bug #1841
  cleanups; converted from .hasnode() to .dep_match() (correct) in
  getworldlist().

*portage-1.9.8 (06 May 2002)

  06 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: 2 fixes that seemed
  to get fried/zapped: bug #1841 and fixing an emerge sync error code to be
  more understandable.

*portage-1.9.7 (06 May 2002)

  06 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: initial
  bunch of robustness/error-handling fixes.  Emerge should now report a
  comprehensible error message for errors in DEPEND and RDEPEND rather than
  giving a traceback.  Fixed dep_depreduce() to catch errors rather than
  passing them on to dep_bestmatch() (which doesn't check for errors and
  assumes correct input)
  
  02 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: typo fix for
  S_ISFIFO call; thanks woodchip!

*portage-1.9.6 (02 May 2002)

  02 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.conf: SYNC variable
  correctly set to use our DNS round-robin system (rsync.gentoo.org).

*portage-1.9.6_pre2 (01 May 2002)

  01 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: config file
  protection upgrade; we now record md5sums of previously-merged config protect
  files in /var/cache/edb/config; we use this information to avoid merging
  files that have been merged by us before (if it is safe to do so).  This 
  doesn't solve the problem of rolling back to a previously-merged version of
  a config file; we need to add cvs headers to every config file to get that
  to work.
  
*portage-1.9.6_pre1 (01 May 2002)

  01 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: added "inject"
  capability to artificially satisfy a dep -- for situations when you don't
  want Portage to do it for you because you've taken care of it already.
  
  01 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: totally
  rewrote emerge's unmerge code.  The original code (added by Bevin) was a bit
  too cryptic and "big" for my taste.  Also added two new capabilities to
  portage.py's vartree: .getslot() and .gettimeval().  getslot() returns the
  slot value of a cat/pkg-v, if any, and gettimeval() returns a "time value"
  (based on mtime/COUNTER value) that can be used to determine the order in
  which packages got merged.  The purpose of these improvements were to revamp
  the existing Portage code that could only unmerge a db entry if there was a
  corresponding ebuild file.  This conflicted with the ability to "inject"
  packages (see above), so it needed to be changed.  Also fixed some bugs along
  the way.
  
  01 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: einstall now
  accepts arguments, closing bug #2275.  Thanks seemant! :)
  
  01 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.globals: switch SYNC
  var from cvs.gentoo.org to rsync.gentoo.org, and gentoo-x86-portage to
  gentoo-portage.
  
  30 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: now checks for
  errors (caused by bad deps) returned by create() and syscreate().

*portage-1.9.5 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: added jnelson's
  KV_extract.awk script which extracts the kernel version from the actual
  kernel sources Makefile, making our KV setting much more robust!  Thanks Jon
  :)
  
  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: correctly fixed
  emerge search examples to use single quotes (to turn off globbing.)  This
  closes bug #1609.

  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: virtual entries
  for no-longer-installed packages now get automatically removed on unmerge.
  This closes bug #2255 and #1891 (Thilo Bangert's comment on #1891 is also
  fixed.)

*portage-1.9.4 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added support
  for RESTRICT="nomirror".  If "mirror" is defined in FEATURES and "nomirror"
  is defined in RESTRICT, then files will not be fetched.
  
  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed docs for
  "unmerge", added docs for "--oneshot".  Closes bugs #2156 and #2182.

  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Fix for USE
  troubles; confirmed by Azarah as working :)  Also, we now strip the path
  from "KV" as we should.

*portage-1.9.4_pre1 (26 Apr 2002)

  26 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> tarball.sh: no longer
  necessary for VERSION to equal "@portage_version@" to get the version
  auto-set.  VERSION can now be set to anything and tarball.sh will get it
  right.
  
  26 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: I've started work
  on revamping/improving the "blocks" system to get ready to fix bug #1891.
  Already fixed a bug where "blocks" ("!" deps) print out the wrong blocking
  package name. This is now fixed.  Blocks need additional testing.
  
  26 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, ebuild.sh, use:
  "use" is now a bash builtin function rather than an external python-based
  command.  This appears to fix the USE inconstencies, as it should, thereby
  closing bug #2000.

*portage-1.9.3 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org>: portage.py, chkcontents:
  Emulate fchksum's md5 checksum routine.  Closes bug #2787.
  
  23 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: emerge: invalid
  short options result in an exit.  Closes bug #2025.
  
  22 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: emerge: rsync zlib
  compression enabled by default.

*portage-1.9.2 (21 Apr 2002)

  21 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: signal
  handler now zaps /etc/ld.so.preload if it's there -- this prevents it
  from hanging around and causing sandbox badness.
  
  21 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: emerge: fixed an
  error where --emptytree mode wouldn't really have a fully empty tree,
  due to the emptytree.inject() coming before the emptytree.root=None;
  the inject() caused a recalc of the USE vars, which caused the tree
  to become partially populated and it wasn't cleared.  This closes bug
  #1897.
  
  21 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: package
  building now executes the "setup" stage along with the unpack, compile,
  install stages so that global variables can be shared.  This fixes an issue
  with woodchip's new apache ebuild and closes bug #1813.

*portage-1.9.1 (16 Apr 2002)

  16 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: tiny (and forgotten)
  quick fix.

*portage-1.9.0 (16 Apr 2002)

  16 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: fetching
  should now try *all* alternate download locations, closing bug #1544. 
  Yay!
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: emerge: "emerge R" now
  works correctly, closing bug #1094.
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: ebuild.sh: *'s and ?'s in
  DEPEND and SRC_URI syntax should no longer get glob-expanded to files in
  /usr/portage.  This fixes some cryptic bugs.  It also closes bug #1473.
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: emerge --debug
  now works again.  Closes bug #1437.
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: moved argument
  check to the beginning of the doebuild() function to prevent "ebuild
  foo.ebuild fart" from causing the md5sums to be checked before recognizing
  that "fart" is not a valid command.  Closes bug #1823.
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: 'USE="-foo"
  emerge bar' should now work correctly and consistently.  Fixes to the config
  class.  Closes bug #1455.
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: applied
  jnelson's patch to properly kill all children when interrupted with ^C
  
  15 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org>: make.conf: added a
  RESUMECOMMAND for lukemftp.
  
  15 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: fixed up some
  "zing" logic inside the merge code (fixing variable being used before
  assignment errors)
  
  15 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org>: src/sandbox/Makefile,
  src/sandbox/problems/Makefile, src/sandbox/problems/sandbox_dev_fd_foo.c,
  src/sandbox/sandbox.c: Cleaned up Makefiles somewhat to take advantage of GNU
  Make, added '/dev/zero' and /dev/fd/' (<- note trailing slash) to the list of
  items accessible safely from the sandbox.  Added sandbox_dev_fd_foo.c to test
  for /dev/fd/<xx>.  The test is almost verbatim from the autoconf test suite.

  13 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>: ebuild.sh:
  Export $S and $D in dyn_compile and dyn_install, as our patched
  version of libtool uses these to fixup .la files.

*portage-1.8.19 (09 Apr 2002)

  08 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org>: emerge: Removed --all switch to
  emerge unmerge and clea.  Added emerge prune which is the same as old emerge
  unmerge.  Emerge unmerge removes all instances again without any proctedtion,
  as before.  Added reporting of Omitted versions due to dep selectors.
  Renamed Removing and Keeping to Selected and Protected

  08 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org>: emerge, portage.py: Better
  unmerge and clean reporting.  Added homepage output to emerge --search.
  Bugfix when specifying a package without category that doesn't exist.

*portage-1.8.18 (07 Apr 2002)

  07 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org>: make.globals, emerge:
  Simplified unmerge functionality. Deprecated the CLEANMODE var,
  emerge clean now removes both revisions and slots automatically,
  emerge unmerge now removes all versions and revisions by default.
  Both understand world and system targets, and the --all option which doesn't
  check which packages are old and outdated.
  Documentation fixes.
  AUTOCLEAN var addition and added the autoclean functionality.
  
*portage-1.8.17 (05 Apr 2002)

  05 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: no longer
  print out the counter number after a merge.  This information should not
  need to be known by end-users.
  
  05 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: sandbox.c: patched to
  allow access to /dev/vc from sandbox, allowing vim and screen to compile
  correctly from console.
  
  05 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: fixed a bug
  that prevented md5 digests from being compared on archives.
  
  04 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: portage.py: Parse errors
  in /etc/env.d files no longer cause a traceback.

*portage-1.8.16 (04 Apr 2002)

  04 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge : Forgot to
  commit my changes, this is an assembled version of both drobbins's and my
  changes

*portage-1.8.15 (04 Apr 2002)

  04 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed a
  semi-long standing bug where I was comparing atimes rather than mtimes when
  seeing if dep caches were stale.  This fixes a bug originally reported by Dan
  Armak.
  
*portage-1.8.14 (04 Apr 2002)

  04 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge:
  Fixed short options for --all, --safe and clean.
  
*portage-1.8.13 (04 Apr 2002)

  04 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  Added emerge --all clean and emerge --safe unmerge.
  Made the counter updates atomic so that multiple merges can happen without
  risking counter clashes.
  Updated --help.
  Fixed short options bug that prevented two seperate short options to be
  specified successively.

*portage-1.8.12 (04 Apr 2002)

  04 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  implemented "emerge clean" with oldrevs, oldversions and oldslots options for
  the make.conf/make.globals CLEANMODE variable.
  
  03 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added an
  indentation fix to prevent merge from dying if a file attempts to install
  itself on top of an existing directory.  Closes bug #1498.

*portage-1.8.11.1 (03 Apr 2002)

  03 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py: important fixes
  for movefile() -- changed the order of ownership / permissions settings since
  suid/guid bits were overwritten, added support back for 'ebuild config' since
  it was accidentally left out

*portage-1.8.11 (02 Apr 2002)

  02 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: important fixes
  for movefile() -- ownership now preserved across filesystems, mv -f fallback
  for special files, other optimizations and robustness improvements.  Important
  fixes all-round.

  02 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge: 
  fixed bad indentation of a part of the code that made unmerging multiple
  packages behave badly

*portage-1.8.10 (01 Apr 2002)

  01 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.globals: removed USE
  settings from make.globals.

  01 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: In trying to fix
  the glibc merge bug, we rewrote movefile() and it now runs blazingly fast.  I
  also tweaked the code to remove the need for an ">>> Updating mtimes..."
  stage.  This is all done dynamically now.  *Much* faster.  And hopefully
  solid for glibc upgraders.

*portage-1.8.9.4 (01 Apr 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: adapted
  movefile() which should preserves timestamps and ownership on files and
  symlinks it moves.

*portage-1.8.9.3 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: promising
  rewrite of movefile() not only will probably fix glibc merge bug but also
  speeds up merging at least 20x!  Calling "mv" for every file really make
  things super-slow!

*portage-1.8.9.2 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: desperate attempt
  to fix movefile() bug... a hack really.  glibc merges still dying.

*portage-1.8.9.1 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: it appears that
  movefile() (using "/bin/mv") can still die if moving a new symlink on top of
  an existing library symlink.  Upon failure, we now use a fallback mechanism
  to use "/bin/sln" to create the new symlink safely.

*portage-1.8.9 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: tiny cosmetic
  fix for digest generation.
  
  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: entries in the
  world profile will be ignored if at least one version of the package in
  question isn't already merged.  Prevents "--update world" from remerging
  packages that have since been unmerged.
  
  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> various: changing all
  references from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python2.2.
  
  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> db-update.py: moving this
  script here from FILESDIR.
  
  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: stuff doesn't
  get added to the world profile if it is already an essential ("*") package in
  the system profile.  Keeps things clean and flexible.

*portage-1.8.9_pre38 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: resolve_key()
  didn't call load() on mapped virtuals, resulting in inconsistent resolution
  of virtual keys.  Now fixed; thanks to woodchip for the bug report.

*portage-1.8.9_pre37 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: specific
  provides (dev-lang/python-2.2) will be converted to their generic form
  (dev-lang/python) before being recorded.

*portage-1.8.9_pre36 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: new
  virtuals fixes and a db-upgrade.py script in the ebuild to solve another
  virtuals problem.

*portage-1.8.9_pre35 (29 Mar 2002)

  29 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: digest
  generation fixes; emerge --update will now update dependents even if the main
  package hasn't been updated.  getdict() fix, fixing a traceback.

*portage-1.8.9_pre34 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added an indent
  fix for the new virtuals code, eliminating a traceback.  Tweaked digest handling,
  fixing a cosmetic error.

*portage-1.8.9_pre33 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: tweaked digest
  creation in doebuild() to hopefully avoid creating digests twice.  I hope I
  didn't break anything in the process.

  28 Mar 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: "emerge
  update" is now "emerge --update"; "world" added back.  New world
  implementation that works like this ... if you type "emerge media-gfx/gimp",
  media-gfx/gimp will be added to the "world" favorites file in
  /var/cache/edb/world.  This world file is added to the system profile in
  order to create the set of "world" packages to merge.  You can manually put
  specific deps (for pinning) in /var/cache/edb/world and they won't get
  overwritten.  To prevent a package that you specify on the emerge
  command-line from being added to the world profile, use the "--oneshot"
  option, which tells emerge that it should be merged once but not updated.
  
  28 Mar 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: New virtuals
  implementation; new virtual info is recorded in /var/cache/edb/virtuals;
  virtuals data is created by merging the profile virtual info with the new
  edb/virtuals file.  Note: We no longer add virtual package entries to
  /var/db/pkg.  This change solves the bug where virtual files get auto-updated
  by pkg-update, and also solves the bug where doing an "emerge --update world"
  will cause ssmtp to be merged in order to satisfy the virtual/mta dep (which
  you already have satisfied by postfix, for example).  Now, postfix will be
  updated if necessary, but that's it. :)

*portage-1.8.9_pre32 (22 Mar 2002)

  22 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed a bug
  related to scanning for available binary packages, which would cause emerge
  to die.
  
  21 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> portage.py: added ECLASSDIR
  (=$PORTDIR/eclass) to settings exported by python side to bash side.
  ebuild.sh: remove ECLASSDIR setting to use the one now provided by
  portage.py.  Also, clean inherit() and make it use debug-print().

*portage-1.8.9_pre31 (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added Dan
  Armak's patch to enable eclasses. :)
  
  21 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> portage.py: 
  Added a drobbins patch to at line 469.  Should fix emerge rsync
  problem when /etc/make.profile doesn't exist.

*portage-1.8.9_pre30 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: emerge
  --emptytree now works again and I added a new --nodeps option to emerge as
  well.

*portage-1.8.9_pre29 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: CONTENTS files
  now record the correct path when ROOT!="/".

*portage-1.8.9_pre28 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: an
  /etc/make.profile dir is now optional and portage will work if it's missing
  or is a broken symlink.
  
  20 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix load()
  method in packagetree() class.

*portage-1.8.9_pre27 (19 Mar 2002)

  19 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  /etc/make.profile/packages wasn't correctly masking core system packages;
  fixed.

*portage-1.8.9_pre26 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: configuration
  settings don't get loaded from ${ROOT}/etc anymore, just /etc.  This
  simplifies the creation of a new build image.
  
  18 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Don't expect a
  digest file if SRC_URI is set to "" or undefined.

  18 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: RDEPEND was getting set
  to DEPEND even if there was an RDEPEND="" in the ebuild.  This has now been
  fixed and RDEPEND will only get to DEPEND if RDEPEND has unset (not "unset
  or null", as it was before this fix.)
  
  18 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: emerge: circular
  dependencies error will result in the digraph dependencies being printed to
  stdout, greatly simplifying debugging.
  
  18 Mar 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org>: src/sandbox/problems: Added
  several sample implementations to reproduce reported bugs.

  18 Mar 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org>: libsandbox.c: All paths are now
  checked for multiple successive slashes anywhere, this closes bug 827.
  Performance should be slightly improved for other apps on the system for who
  the sandbox is not turned on.
  
  14 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: output.py: quick fix to
  turn off white color output -- not good for terminals with white background.
  This closes bug #1135.
  
  11 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Applied karltk's version
  information patch.  Portage.py now contains version information, and this
  info is reported by "emerge --version".  Thanks Karl! :)
 
*portage-1.8.9_pre25 (11 Mar 2002)
 
  10 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge: roll
  back portagetree incremental db optimizations to fix an important bug (no
  package.mask calculations being done.)  Emerge will now abort if a dependency
  can't be satisfied rather than printing just a warning.

*portage-1.8.9_pre24 (09 Mar 2002)

  09 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed missing
  "--clean" option so "--clean rsync" should work again.  Also converted emerge
  to work with our new db layout (db objects are in the portage module now).

  09 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added USE
  ordering, a concept envisioned by Vitaly Kushneriuk.  The idea is to allow
  customization of how Portage resolves USE variables.  The default is
  "env:conf:auto:defaults" (set in the USE_ORDER variable -- this default is
  now in make.globals but as always you should set your custom USE_ORDER in
  make.conf if desired.)  So, my default, USE settings will be calculated as
  follows.  The USE variables will be grabbed from the
  /etc/make.profile/make.defaults file (this is "defaults".) Then, the
  /etc/make.profile/use.defaults file will be consulted.  This file lists (one
  per line) a USE variable and a corresponding dependency.  If the dependency
  is satisfied, the USE variable is auto-enabled and added to our working list
  (this is "auto").  Then /etc/make.conf is consulted, so that the user has the
  option of force-enabling (with USE="foo") or force-disabling (with
  USE="-foo") any USE variables as desired (this is "conf".)  Then, the
  environment is consulted, allowing easy modifications from the command-line
  (this is "env").  Also added is the ability for USE settings to be
  dynamically regenerated in an efficient way as packages are merged.  So,
  right after xfree is emerged, the "X" use variable can be immediately
  auto-enabled.  Thanks to Vitaly for providing the vision for this.

*portage-1.8.9_pre23 (08 Mar 2002)

  09 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: our portage
  tree and /var/db/pkg tree now uses incremental caching rather than doing
  an exhaustive scan on startup.  This should speed up this respective code
  by 2-30x depending on how many packages you're emerging.  This involved
  quite a few changes to the code, and there could be some bugs, although I
  tried to be very careful.  These changes could also break code that access
  internal .tree[] dictionaries directly. 
  
  08 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: SRC_URIs with
  USE-enabled ( ) clauses in them weren't working because I was iterating
  through multi-level lists without flatten()ing them.  Now fixed.
  
  07 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: We no longer
  depend upon a file being unmerged.  We try to unlink during unmerge() in a
  "try" clause, with an exception for OSError.  If the directory is immutable
  then Portage continues gracefully.  This closes a bug reported by Verwilst --
  unmerging an old baselayout would die when it tried to delete /dev/shm.
  Fixed in Portage to eliminate these kinds of problems in the future.

*portage-1.8.9_pre22 (07 Mar 2002)

  07 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: I had
  sys.exit() in doebuild()'s fetch section.  Converted to "return 1" and
  "return 0" to be emerge --fetchonly friendly.  Thanks to Dan Armak for the
  bug report.

*portage-1.8.9_pre21 (07 Mar 2002)

  07 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: fixed symlink
  merge bug related to "safe" emerges.  This should fix problems of Portage
  dying when merging certain things.  I'm hoping that this fix will give us a
  solid merge implementation.  It should.  Thanks to Bart Verwilst for tracking
  down a merge problem that I could reproduce.

*portage-1.8.9_pre20 (06 Mar 2002)

  06 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh, others: users
  can now forcefully disable stripping of their ebuild binaries by adding a
  RESTRICT="nostrip" to their ebuild.  Additionally, the DEBUG variable has
  been renamed to DEBUGBUILD to prevent namespace collisions.  This closes bug
  #868.
  
  06 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : Fixed a
  long-standing bug where the pkg_preinst() and pkg_postinst() functions being
  called came from the existing package ebuild in /var/db/pkg rather than the
  new ebuild being merged.  pkg_prerm() and pkg_postrm() still use the ebuild
  in /var/db/pkg, which is correct.  Thanks to Dan Armak for tracking down this
  bug.

*portage-1.8.9_pre19 (05 Mar 2002)
  
  05 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : Fixed two bugs
  reported by Dan Armak relating to incomplete (not missing) message digests.
  They should now get regenerated automatically is "digest" is in FEATURES and
  not confuse the fetch code.

*portage-1.8.9_pre18 (04 Mar 2002)

  04 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : Bug fix in
  dep_bestmatch(); rev comparison now works correctly and dep_bestmatch will
  properly handle 2-digit revisions in particular.  This closes bug #952.
  
  04 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : Thanks to a
  bug report by Bruce Locke, the long-standing bug where symlinks with
  different mtimes would still get unmerged is now fixed.  This allows glibc
  (of all things) to be unmerged safely.  We needed this fix.  Closes bug #964.
  
  03 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : KDEDIR ->
  KDEDIRS (fixing my typo)

*portage-1.8.9_pre17 (27 Feb 2002)

  27 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge : --help
  documentation is now up-to-date; short options tweaked.
  
  26 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : Fixed an
  unmerge error caused by digests now being recorded in lowercase.  unmerge now
  compensates for 100% backwards compatibility.  Moved "continue" outside of
  "try" block since this is disallowed in Python.  This fixes a python warning
  during fetch.
  
  26 Feb 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> bin/dohtml : Added support for
  installing .gif files too since quite some docs still ship with those instead
  of .jpg or .png.

*portage-1.8.9_pre16 (25 Feb 2002)

  25 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge : emerge syntax
  changed back to "classic" style; replaced dots with spinner, did a major code
  cleanup and removed pieces that will be rewritten for 1.8.9 final.  emerge
  documentation isn't up-to-date at all; I'm holding off on the --help rewrite
  until after 1.8.9 features have been finalized (soon!)
 
  25 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : Added RESTRICT variable
  to ebuilds.  If RESTRICT="fetch" is set in the ebuild, it means that the
  files listed in SRC_URI are simply filenames and that the real files must be
  downloaded manually.  This allows us to deal with realplayer, since
  overriding dyn_fetch is no longer an option now that we have the fetch code
  in python.  Also added a cosmetic tweak to emerge during info file
  regeneration.
  
  25 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> cnf/* : updated ${x} ->
  ${URI} in $FETCHCOMMAND.

  24 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> Fixed another fetch bug
  where the download wouldn't cycle to alternate mirrors (it'd get stuck on
  the first download location)

*portage-1.8.9_pre15 (24 Feb 2002)

  24 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: some fixing of
  the merge code; added automatic digest generation when "digest" is in
  FEATURES; made the fetch() code not depend on a pre-existing digest.  This
  should fix all known digest/fetch issues.

*portage-1.8.9_pre14 (23 Feb 2002)

  23 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: If you have a
  file that's hosted directly on our master ibiblio mirror, you can specify
  it in SRC_URI as "http://mirror/myfile.tar.bz2".  "http://mirror" will be
  expanded to the first mirror defined in GENTOO_MIRRORS, or our master ibiblio
  mirror if no mirrors are defined.  Groovy.  This closes bug #627.
  
  23 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.globals, emerge,
  portage.py: wget is no longer hardcoded; FETCHCOMMAND is enabled again, but
  uses ${FILE} and ${URI} instead of ${x} and ${y} now.  Added download
  resuming, which requires the definition of RESUMECOMMAND (added to
  make.globals).  Updated spawn() so that when it's called as spawn(foo,free=1)
  as an argument, sandboxing is turned off.  Replaced all calls to
  os.system(foo) with spawn(foo,free=1), since os.system() messes with signal
  handling.  Added a default SIGINT signal handler to portage.py so that ^C
  interrupts are handled correctly (portage will immediately exit with a return
  code of 1).  This has been tested and works for ebuild and emerge.  These
  additions should also close bug #407 and #760.
 
  23 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: spython -> python
  fix; resolution of cvs merge conflict.  Removed edepend assignment bug
  reintroduced in Geert's commit; added comment explaining why the new code is
  needed so it doesn't get removed again ;)

  22 Feb 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge: removed spurious cvs
  conflict lines fixed bug in the cleanup code where different slots weren't
  handled too well

*portage-1.8.9_pre13 (22 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> various: fix /bin/sh
  symlink merge problems and massively simplified movefile() code.  Added back
  some emerge code so that "emerge --search rsync" doesn't run rsync.

*portage 1.8.9_pre12 (22 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: everything
  should now generate *lowercase* md5sums, fixing problems with digest 
  backwards compatibility.
  
  22 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: changed
  position of digest generation call so that "ebuild digest" now works if the
  sources have not yet been downloaded.
  
*portage 1.8.9_pre11 (22 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: unmerging now
  works correctly.

*portage 1.8.9_pre10 (22 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: "emerge" didn't like the
  new portage.py (fixed); A merge database bug (fixed).  Fixing the merge bug
  should also result in merges happening much faster than before, maybe up to 3
  times as fast.  We no longer resolve symlinks when testing protection paths.

*portage 1.8.9_pre9 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: moved entirety of Portage
  download/digest code from ebuild.sh (bash) to portage.py (python).  No
  support for custom FETCHCOMMANDs yet, but that's coming soon.  Good news is
  that it appears to work well and allowed some cleanups and optimizations to
  doebuild().  SYNC support added.  See cnf/make.conf for more info --
  basically, "emerge rsync" (now callable via "emerge sync" as well) supports a
  configurable "Portage server" that begins either with "rsync://" or "cvs://".
  "emerge sync" is now not only a clean front-end, but a configurable front-end
  to the Portage update process.  I also removed dependency checking from
  'ebuild'.  This allowed me to removed some redundant code from portage.py,
  and seemed fine to do since 'ebuild' is more and more becoming a low-level
  developer tool.
  
  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: rewrite of cumulative USE
  setting code so that the new FEATURES (what used to be called MAINTAINER) is
  now cumulative and supports "-" and "-*" options.  FEATURES is expanded using
  all config files, while USE ignores make.globals but uses everything else.
  Optimization of a couple parts of doebuild().  Upgraded expandpath() and used
  it in one place where it was removed accidentally (in the new merge code.)
  Master category list is now stored externally in
  ${PORTDIR}/profiles/categories for ease of maintenance.
  
  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: now supports the
  EMERGE_OPTS make.conf variable for enabling emerge options by default.
  Closes bug #605.
  
  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: dep_match() now
  works with * deps (again?  Looks like the code got ripped out somehow); this
  closes bug #490.
  
  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> global change from
  "spython" -> "python", now that Portage is slick enough to update shared
  libraries correctly.
  
  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> bin/chkcontents,
  man/chkcontents.1: New script to compare what's in a package's CONTENTS file
  with what's actually on the filesystem.  Useful for discovering that a
  package "collision" has occurred.

  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh, portage.py:
  Dependencies should be no longer checked during the "unpack" stage.  This
  closes bug #231.  Added the $KV kernel version variable to ebuild.sh so that
  it's available for all ebuilds.  This closes bug #599.
  
  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: S now defaults
  to ${WORKDIR}/${P} if it isn't defined.  That's right.  Defining S is now
  optional :)  This should eliminate around 1000 lines from our ports tree.
  
  20 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed some
  major bugs in the new merge/config protect code.  Merging and config
  protection should now work.
  
  18 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge,
  ebuild.sh : Rewrote merge code.  Should merge symlinks only *after* the
  target has been merged (needs testing).  Added lots of comments.  Split
  dblink.merge() into 2 new functions -- .walktree() and .mergeme().
  Cleaned/optimized merging a good deal.  Added special "-*" USE variable to
  unset *all* USE variables defined up until that point.  
  
  18 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge,
  ebuild.sh : Fixed USE bug (config.reset() threw away our cumulative USE),
  streamlined turbo dep calculations by moving edb cache entry creation to
  ebuild.sh.  Started coding new dblink.merge() method that should be much
  cleaner, faster and merge symlinks safely.
 
  17 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py : Added
  cumulative USE variable support.  The final USE var is calculated
  cumulatively starting with make.profile, then make.conf, and then the
  environment.  Any "-foo" option in USE will turn off a previously-defined USE
  setting.  So, if you want to use the profile-default USE settings except turn
  "X" off, you add 'USE="-X"' to /etc/make.conf and that's it.  This greatly
  simplifies USE variable maintenance since developers can now easily add new
  USE variables that default to 'on'.  Simply add the USE variable and then add
  it to make.profile.  It will then be included in everyone's USE variables
  automatically unless they explicitly "-newvar" in /etc/make.conf or in the
  local environment.  This also enables easy one-shot disabling of USE
  variables.  For example, to merge xchat without GNOME support (when "gnome"
  is in your /etc/make.conf USE variable), simply type "USE="-gnome" emerge
  net-irc/xchat".  This is a lot easier than temporarily tweaking
  /etc/make.conf.
 
  17 Feb 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge : Added a quick hack
  to cache ebuild dependency info using extended attributes on XFS filesystems.
  Gives a factor of 10 speedup for dependency calculations.  Will look into a
  generic caching solution that should offer similar performance increases on
  all filesystems.  Note: the fact that this hack is on CVS means that emerge
  is currently in a hyper-experimental state and shouldn't be used right now.
 
  16 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge : added support for 'emerge
  cat/pkg-version' instead of always having to require 'emerge cat/pkg'
  
  15 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge : reimplemented the display
  of cleaned packages to clearly show all versions that are about to be removed
  and which versions are going to stay  

  13 Feb 2002; D.Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added --emptytree option

  13 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py :
  fixed little bug where emerge --clean rsync wasn't correctly handled anymore
  implemented all new functionalities of emerge --clean, this adds --slots,
  --versions and --all options together with world and system modes

  12 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py :
  changed emerge --zap to emerge --clean
  removed parts of the already implemented slots functionality to be able to
  fall back to a more flexible implementation. Binary compatible slots will now
  mostly influence emerge during the --clean operation

  12 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added fallback check in case UNMERGE_DELAY hasn't been defined in
  make.globals or make.conf

*portage 1.8.9_pre8 (18 Feb 2002)

  12 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  changed the rebuild code to use depgraph instead, dramatically reducing code
  duplication

  11 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  changed indentation of a code part that wasn't at the right level. It got the
  count of the non slot packages during --zap completely wrong

*portage 1.8.9_pre7 (11 Feb 2002)

  11 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  fixed bug in packagetree.dep_match() where a ~ dependency is returned as a
  string instead of as a list
  
  11 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  - removed support for --all and world in 'emerge --unmerge', by default now
    all matching packages are removed since with the new slots functionality
    old package versions should not exists anymore
  - colored package name red too when a blocking package is found during
    pretend operation
  - changed emerge invocation arguments to be in a new universal interface
    format this has been decided to be :
	'emerge --action --option --option [packageset]'
	some features however don't respect this, but that's since they are not
	package installation related and are easier to use as straight commands
	eg: emerge rsync
  - added UNMERGE_DELAY var to make.globals and support it in emerge to obtain
    the number of seconds to wait
  - support for NOCOLOR="yes" as wel as NOCOLOR="true"
  - major speedups for emerge -search
  - added formatted package descriptions of the matches from emerge --search
    that nicely wrap at 80 chars
  - rewrote retrieval of package descriptions to support descriptions that are
    specified on multiple lines
  - added support for 'noslot' to --zap, --update and --rebuild
  
  11 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> sandbox.c, libsandbox.c :
  added checks to see if the files where information is written to are really
  regular files and not symlinks

*portage 1.8.9_pre6 (10 Feb 2002)

  10 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added support for 'emerge --unmerge world' which removes all old package
  versions from the system
  made 'emerge --unmerge' take binary compatibility slots into account, this
  prevents that packages with different versions but also different slots, are
  being unmerged
  added support for "--verbose" in "emerge rebuild" and "emerge world" to
  provide details about packages that aren't in the local tree anymore and to
  notify the user about which packages don't support slots

  9 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added support for the rebuild mode which rebuilds all the packages on your
  system for which a corresponding package could be found in to portage tree

  9 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  renamed getEbuildPaths() or vartree to getebuildpaths()
  fixed bug in the merging of binary packages

  7 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> xpack.py :
  added additional argument to tbz2.getfile() which allows default content to
  be provided when the requested file couldn't be found in the tbz2 archive

  7 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh :
  added SLOT information as the third entry in the temporary deps file that is
  generated during ebuild depend,
  
  7 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  obtain SLOT information from the deps file instead of using the slotgrab()
  function, removed slotgrab() function, updated some comments

  7 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added SLOT information to the generated edepend var for binary packages

*portage 1.8.9_pre5 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  fixed bugs where the old instance wasn't unmerged correctly if slots are
  identical, but ebuild version numbers not

  6 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf :
  Copied proxy lines from make.globals (bug 431).

  6 Feb 2002; Vitaly Kushneriuk <vitaly@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  added missing SLOT param to merge(...).
  
*portage 1.8.9_pre4 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  fixed some bugs in the handling of PROVIDES and virtual packages together
  with slots, they used code that wasn't upudated to the new dblink constructor
  virtuals now use "" as slot, resulting in normally to same behaviour as what
  has been done before.
  
  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  sorted the packages to unmerge since this makes package names with revision
  endings appear before plain version numbers. This makes the unmerge code
  first remove the old and non slot aware packages before removing the newer
  alternative which is in fact exactly the same apart from the revision
  identifier.

*portage 1.8.9_pre3 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  only let the backward compatibility algorithm kick in during unmerge since
  it's impossible to correctly detect is in general.

*portage 1.8.9_pre2 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  fixed bug in the backward compatibility algorithm

*portage 1.8.9_pre1 (5 Feb 2002)

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh, emerge, portage.py :
  added binary compatibility slots, this also contains additional code to keep
  the unmerging of packages backwards compatible.
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  added back support for the "ebuild help" command which seems to have
  disappeared somewhere along the updates
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> make.conf, make.globals :
  added description and default entry for the imlib USE variable
  added flag to prozilla to disable prozilla's waiting for a user's keypress
  when a failure occurs
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> output.py :
  bugfix, write read() function instead of red(), doh !
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py :
  implemented the ! dependency which prevents incompatible packages to be
  installed on the same system at the same time

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  most emerge invocation options now have alternative short flags
  
  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  emerge now doesn't unmerge the last version of an installed version by
  default anymore, to really remove all instanced of packages the --all flag
  has to be used, the --safe flag is deprecated
  
  3 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> output.py, emerge,make.globals :
  all output can now be turned to black and white by using the functions in 
  output.py, this determines the mode by checking to NOCOLOR variable in
  make.conf or make.globals

  3 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  made it possible to run emerge --help and --search as non root

*portage 1.8.8-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py, ebuild.sh, ebuild.5 :
  added support for a pkg_setup() function which is executed before anything
  else and can be typically used for package configuration actions or required
  system checks

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  implemented the noauto MAINTAINER flags for all relevant ebuild commands

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  make env-update disregard backup files
  
  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added --pretend support instead of interactively asking to proceed,
  also added a delay before unmerging though to be sure

*portage 1.8.8 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added --safe switch to complement the --unmerge option

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  rewrote the packagename without category support to also graceously handle
  deps specifiers at the beginning, this shouldn't be used in the ebuilds, but
  are very handy when using emerge --unmerge

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> emerge :
  added emerge --unmerge support

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage.py :

  20 Jan 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> dojar :
  added dojar shell command as a java JAR handler

  17 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  The package chosen by "emerge sys-apps/shadow" now matches that chosen in an
  emerge update or emerge system.  I forgot to add some "*" dep code to the

*portage 1.8.5 (13 Jan 2002)

  13 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ebuilds.sh, portage.py:
  added fine grained maintainer settings

*portage 1.8.4 (13 Jan 2002)

  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  "emerge sys-apps/bash/" now works. (trailing "/" stripped to make
  tab-completion users happy)  This fixes bug #119

  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  Portage should no longer bomb out if the current working directory doesn't
  exist (has been deleted from underneath).
  
  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  added "--world" option for "emerge update".   This tells Portage to update
  the base system *as well as* upgrade any packages that are currently
  installed but have new versions available.  This is your standard full system
  update command.  This fixes bug #122

  12 Jan 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  Added an expandpath() cache which speeds up merging dramatically.

*portage 1.8.3 (11 Jan 2002)

  11 Jan 2002; Mikael Hallendal <hallski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh:
  added functions econf and einstall. Also made src_compile having a default

  07 Jan 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> :
  sandbox included in portage
	
*portage 1.8.1 (30 Dec 2001)

  29 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  "emerge update" is now functional!  Although the algorithm really should be
  sound, it is still considered in testing since we may need to tweak some
  dependencies.

  27 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  Removed objprelink from the default USE variable.

*portage 1.8.0 (22 Dec 2001)

  22 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> :
  I messed up the "transparent .so library" update.  Included is the correct
  fix, which seems to allow glibc to update on my system without any tricks.
  I just merged a new glibc while in X, without using any of glibc's old
  pkg_postinst/pkg_preinst hacks.
  
  21 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> make.defaults.5, make.conf.5 :
  Moved make.defaults.5 to make.conf.5 and updated contents.

*portage 1.7.8 (21 Dec 2001)

  21 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  ebuild install doesn't throw away the compile directory if ebuild has been
  changed and MAINTAINER is set; we now use mv -f to move files into location
  on the filesystem, making our library install method even more robust. It
  should now be totally safe to  upgrade glibc while in X and playing music
  with xmms and surfing the Web and compiling 20 applications at once :)

* portage 1.7.7 (14 Dec 2001)

  14 Dec 2001; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>: portage.py :
  movefile() now unlink()s the destination file first which solves shared
  library install problems.

* portage 1.7.6 (13 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  env_update() now generates an /etc/csh.env file in csh shell format.

* portage 1.7.5 (13 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  added a little fix so a ~ dep isn't satisfied by a *much* later installed
  version; i.e. ~media-libs/freetype-1.3.1 satisfied by
  media-libs/freetype-2.0.5 being installed.
  
  30 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild :
  added a KeyboardInterrupt handler so ^C'ing a running ebuild process doesn't
  produce a Python traceback.

* portage 1.7.4 (29 Nov 2001)

  29 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  removed an unnecessary quirk in the code preventing virtual packages from
  being in any other category but "virtual".
  
  25 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge :
  info file detection code has been improved.  

* portage 1.7.3 (20 Nov 2001)

  20 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> pdb, pdb.cgi, xpak :
  used /usr/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/spython.  Fixed.

* portage 1.7.2 (13 Nov 2001)

  13 Nov 2001; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> :
  emake will now try to build in parallel, and if it fails, will retry in
  non-parallel mode.
  
  13 Nov 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh :
  an ebuild that used an archive with a name that was part of another archive
  would cause Portage to mess up the digest check.  No longer.

  31 Oct 2001; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> make.conf, make.globals :
  comments about merging the fetch programs before trying to use them.

* portage 1.7.1 (30 Oct 2001)

  30 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  I accidentally broke "=" deps by being sloppy when I added "*" deps.  Trivial
  fix applied.

* portage 1.7 (29 Oct 2001)

  29 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  strange typo fix in the empty() digraph method.

* portage 1.6.12 (29 Oct 2001)

  29 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  "*" deps now implemented. "=sys/foo-1*" matches the latest 1.x version/rev of
  sys/foo, but will not match a 2.x version.

  26 Oct 2001; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py :
  various new categories added.

Portage 1.6.11, released 18 Oct 2001
====================================

	*portage.py; device nodes are now not unmerged at all.


Portage 1.6.10, released 18 Oct 2001 
===================================

	*ebuild.sh: A and AA fix; now any A="foo" lines in the ebuild are ignored,
	allowing ebuilds with them to continue working.
	
	*portage.py: remove gnome-apps, gnome-office, gnome-libs, add gnome-extra
	categories.

	*ebuild.sh, portage.py: You can now use USE variables in SRC_URI to
	conditionally include archives.  In MAINTAINER mode, all archives are
	automatically included so that maintainers can check SRC_URIs and also
	generate complete digests.  A new file-based DEPEND and RDEPEND-passing
	mechanism has been added.
	
	*ebuild.sh Now adds filesize to the digest files

Portage 1.6.9, released 15 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	unmerge() now does not touch device nodes.  Unlinking them or touching them
	in any way is bad practice.


Portage 1.6.8, released 12 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	movefile() will now unlink() destfile if it is a symlink.  Should fix 
	problems where file gets created at symlink target rather than replacing
	the symlink.

	*queryhost.sh (agriffis)
	Parallel pinging and other fixes.

Portage 1.6.7, released 05 Sep 2001
===================================

	*portage.py
	(last-minute fix)
	CONFIG_PROTECT unmerge protection is now observed for symlinks, fifos and
	device nodes.
	
	*portage.py
	Fixes for unmerging CONFIG_PROTECTed files.  Protected files are now *not*
	unlinked from the filesystem.  Messier but safer, and simplifies package
	upgrades.

	*emerge
	Emerge output cleanups for GNU info directory generation.  New --verbose
	mode; new CONFIG_PROTECT scanning feature to let people know when there are
	config files to be updated.  New "--help config" docs to explain how to
	do it.

Portage 1.6.6, released 01 Sep 2001
====================================

	*portage.py
	Upgraded directory merging over existing objects.  Existing symlinks that
	point to existing directories will be kept and used as is; directories will
	be used as-is; any other objects (broken symlinks, files) will be copied
	to origfilename.backup and a ne directory will be created in its place.

Portage 1.6.5, released 31 Aug 2001
====================================
	
	*emerge 
	Fixes for handling multiple ebuilds, packages and/or dependencies on
	the command-line.

	*portage.py 
	An optimization to the digraph class so that the firstzero() method finds
	matches in close to the order that keys were added to the digraph.
