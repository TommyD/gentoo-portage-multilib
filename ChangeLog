  MAJOR CHANGES in 2.0.51:
    1. /var/cache/edb/virtuals is no longer used at all. It's calculated now.
    2. /var/cache/edb/world is now /var/lib/portage/world
    3. /etc/portage/virtuals is _USER_ configs only. Do not copy the old file.
    4. /etc/portage/sets/world is a symlink to /var/lib/portage/world
       It is for convenience. Do not mistake this for the actual file.

  05 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/regenworld:
  Added a --help message ro regenworld.

  03 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed bug #52720
  and restored patch for a 35% drop in dep calc time.

*portage-2.0.51_pre10 (02 Jun 2003): Fixes

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added MANPATH
  to the colon_seperated list -- parsing code NEEDS TO BE FIXED. * and ~*
  matches allowed for package.use for arch-development -- ~* implies *.

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fix for a new
  typo in the logger function that prevented emerge.log from being written.

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: make test
  only occurs when enabled in FEATURES and not in RESTRICT -- defaults OFF.
  Added ferringb's local B_* fix for eclasses. Made db vars readonly via bash
  for non-depend phases after the global scope.
  
  02 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Reverted
  adjusted made to config.setcpv on 18 May 2004 due to bug #52720.

  01 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman,bin/regenworld:
  only messages about broken log entries in regenworld when called with
  --debug. Fix signing stuff in repoman.

*portage-2.0.51_pre9 (22 May 2003): Speedups and bug fixes

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_template.py:
  Added in last-three caching for db modules. Ensuring that keys are strings.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_cpickle.py: Fix
  that ensures the Unpickler works properly.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Updates for
  environment files ordering in ebuild.sh. Added in normalize_path to handle
  the really annoying "'//' is a legal prefix" issue with os.path.normpath.
  Applied normalize_path to cacheddir() so that the keys match and we have
  more cache hits and better performance. Added statistics to to cacheddir
  available with noise=2. Do not return a blocker when doing a zerolist.
  Fixed the stacking functions to properly order the incrementals and apply
  the removals forward. Changed all string.atoi() to int(). Added in the
  selinux changes for spawning the fetch command. Added a patch that allows
  ebuild.sh to display 'validcommands'. close_caches() added to allow atexit
  to close all the DB connections. close_portdbapi_cache() handles the global
  that has all db instances -- This avoids problems with the API nulling the
  internal links. Adjusted the db handling for sync() calls and removed some
  object duplication db calls.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Fix for HTTP
  redirects (301 and 302) so that the redirect opens a new connection to the
  move-location server -- This allows us to redirect to a different machine.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: For iuse output we
  now ensure that the correct db is referenced. The worldfile additions do not
  occur when a packages is new and updates are not being performed. Patch to
  add binutils to the emerge info.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Rearranged the
  sourcing of the profiles and the special environment files. Added src_test
  as an optional test method -- Some packages are extremely dumb and need to
  be prevented from using this via RESTRICT.

  18 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Minor speed
  improvement in config.setcpv preventing a useless regenerate

  18 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reversed the
  order of config.getvirtuals' stack_dictlist call for correct ordering.

*portage-2.0.51_pre8 (16 May 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py: New
  file containing portage exceptions. Added 'CorruptionError' for the db code.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: New file
  that contains utility functions. Allows db_modules to use portage functions
  without a circular dependency. CODE IS DUPLICATED and needs to be fixed in
  portage.py to use this new module. grab*, getconfig, varexpand, pickle_*,
  ReadOnlyConfig

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Modules
  do not have an __init__ any longer -- module_init() is called by the
  template after loading the config and setting the 5 variables inside of
  the class. self.config is a ReadOnlyConfig object which is just a dict
  that you can't write to. Throws CorruptionError when the read functions
  return exceptions. 

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reversed the
  virtuals order so it matches the documented format. When an ebuild does not
  exist, we now raise a KeyError with a useful string. 'couple minutes' changed
  to 'couple of minutes' for Seemant. ;)

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip, ebuild.5,
  repoman.1: Typo corrections/text replacements.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added deprecation
  notice to 'emerge rsync' to favor 'emerge sync'. Modified the emerge.log
  code to not change permissions on the files beyond what is necessary -- NEEDS
  TO BECOME AN ADDITIVE FUNCTION. Produce a warning instead of a traceback
  when an ebuild does not exist for -U.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Touched up the
  logging stuff at the top. Removed extra_functions.sh. src_compile additions
  so that it can run make without having a config file requirement.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dobin,dosbin: Removed the
  duplicated stripping from the helper tools.

  09 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  fixed bug in use_reduce that caused returned list to be flattened.

  30 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  modified ebuild.sh error message on seemants and roger55s request.

*portage-2.0.51_pre7 (26 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed masking
  problems due to the new stacking functions and empty-value stripping.

*portage-2.0.51_pre6 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Dropped selinux
  from the IUSE complainer list.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Made it use the
  constants defined in portage.py for the world file.
  
  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Modifications
  so that the virtuals are incremented in the proper order and reversed the
  final values so that the first virtual is the 'best' one. Try to put the
  INHERITED variable back into the environment before calling out to portage.
  This makes the ECLASS QA notices actually valid.

*portage-2.0.51_pre5 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed name
  of the world file constant. Fixed the virtuals loading and vartree creation
  circular dep with a repitition hack. Fixed the virtuals loading function so
  that it doesn't destroy the virtuals before saving them.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed all the
  references to the world file to use portage constants. Made the verbose
  output for use flags call unique array to make sure values aren't duped.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Typo fix for
  inherited, and removed the delay.

*portage-2.0.51_pre4 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Creation of
  a great number of 'constants' that were hard coded in various places and
  now are created in a cascaded style, for the most part. Exception handling
  for the loading of modules added along with verbose messages about the
  exception being handled for user info. PRIVATE_PATH is a new constant that
  points to the new directory we will be using for portage internal data --
  It is a secure directory that only group portage may write, read, and scan.
  PORTAGE_CACHEDIR is deprecated -- The real cache directory is FHS and is a
  constant -- The dep cache is named specifically now as 'PORTAGE_DEPCACHEDIR'.
  
  **Changed the stacking functions** so they are quite a bit more sane -- They
  still need a little help though -- stack_* functions are now used to stack
  specific types instead of using grab_stacked "super functions" -- The naming
  is a little rough but intelligable.
  
  **VIRTUALS modification** The /var/cache/edb/virtuals file is unnecessary
  as portage now loads the provides from the vartree itself. /etc/portage
  may have a virtuals file that stacks on top of the var and profile virtuals.
  This also entails the removal of the virtual-file handling code (yay!).

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fix for the name
  change for PORTAGE_CACHEDIR to PORTAGE_DEPCACHEDIR.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added checks
  to ensure that use flags are properly mentioned in IUSE. Adjusted the QA
  Interceptors (function overrides for common app names) to make sure they
  don't interfere in weird cases -- Relying on 'type -p' now. Eclasses are
  checked for illegal inheritance modes (conditional-based). Increased the
  cache lines for an entry -- Added 'PROVIDE' and 8 empties.

  22 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  added a CVS Header check to repoman

  20 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  fix for getmaskingreason if the mask isn't in PORTDIR's package.mask (#48447)

  17 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: Fixed for
  python-2.2 compatibility.

*portage-2.0.51_pre3 (13 Apr 2003): Cleanups and small features.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Fixed the
  permissions issues regarding the umask problems with DB vars.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix for the
  import urllib call that was misspelled for PORTAGE_BINHOST. Genone's patch
  that allows FETCHCOMMAND_${PROTOCOL}. getmaskingreadon() from genone's
  package.mask display patch.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: For some reason
  people have a problem with my bad spelling of semi-common colors, so I added
  in requested changes for the color 'fuchsia'.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf: Comment
  fixes for the CHOST line. FEATURES modification.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf.conf: Removed
  the 'a' option.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Catagory searches
  added if search is prefixed with '@'. jstubbs/spider's fix for binary use
  flag passing problems worked in. Genone's patch for package.mask comment
  display. Patch to display warnings when unmerging system packages worked in.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Quieted up
  some output for use/has internally. Added a patch for the help output.
  Added functionality to pass down IUSE from eclasses. Made several variables
  readonly inside of ebuilds:
    P PN PV PVR PR A AA D EBUILD EMERGE_FROM O PPID FILESDIR EBUILD_PHASE

*portage-2.0.51_pre2 (11 Apr 2003): Release Fixes

  11 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Portage can now
  match categories if the search is prefixed with an '@' -- @app-portage will
  list all packages in app-portage... '@portage' will match all in app-portage
  and will match anything with portage in the title -- It's still a regex.

  11 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: nostrip in
  RESTRICT now enables DEBUGBUILD -- stripping and related functionality
  needs to get cleaned up better.

  11 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> etc-update, ebuild.sh:
  Fixed infinity loop in etc-update(#19144). Fixed glob problem in 
  ebuild.sh(#37066). Fixed deleting build-info problem with
  FEATURES="keepwork"(#29044).
  
  10 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Includes the
  deadlock breaks marked with 'XXX:' to indicate where fixes are needed. Added
  HTTP encoding to PORTAGE_BINHOST with checks and fallbacks. Fallback for
  dbkey settings spawned from ebuild. Exception handling for db classes in
  the case of random corruption. jstubb's fix for the dep code to handle
  empty lists, added a notice about that being rude.

  10 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Made more QA
  notices and made them slightly more pretty 'QA Notice:'. Made the depend
  phase trap less violent -TERM not -KILL.

  10 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: Added IUSE missings
  a check(#21544).

  10 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> tarball.sh, pym/portage.py:
  Fixing broken regexp in fixdbentries() (bug 46096), changing version
  number.

  01 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed 
  virtuals in reverse order(jstubbs's patch and my fix).
  This should close #45468.

  all the db modules to be current and correct and updated the testing code
  to make sure everything is working properly.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Removed some
  functions: evaluate, dep_listcleanup, dep_getjiggy. Made inheritance for
  profiles relative from the profile's directory instead of from the profile's
  base directory. OBSOLETING two functions dep_parenreduce and dep_opreduce in
  favor of the new code in portage_dep paren_reduce and use_reduce. dep_zapdeps
  got an overhaul for much more intelligent selection of packages and virtual
  handling during depgraph generation. Binary tree enhancements and selection
  enhancements. bindbapi created to do aux_get on binaries. isInjected added
  to vardbapi to get injected status. SRC_URI uses the new portage_dep code
  to handle strings now -- nesting should would flawlessly and FEATURES=cvs
  should get _all_ files.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_cpickle.py:
  Added pickle loading safety.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep: Temp home

  Fixed some repoman/portage bugs. repoman shouldn't use /etc/portage/*
  files. repoman shouldn't use PORTDIR_OVERLAY(#11335). repoman should use
  each arch profile dir(#43601). portage didn't handle virtual dependency
  with version (>=virtual/package-1.0) in some places.

  05 Mar 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Trivial fix for emerge -pv if the download size is a long.

  03 Mar 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman,

  bin/emergehelp.py, man/emerge.1:
  Updated docs for --update and removed the "help" action (wasn't working
  anyway).

  29 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed 
  wrong USE in 'emerge info'. This should fix #34260.

  27 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed info dir

  SRC_URI bug when FEATURES="cvs". This should close #16159.

  12 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, pym/portage.py:
  TGL's patch for correction package size when emerge -v. -- Fixed
  use.default bug. It occurs when package in use.default exists in system
  and it's virtual package. This should close #40831. 

  12 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed 
  --ask bugs. It breaks with "--clean". It also breaks when blocker
  exists.  This should close #39865.

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix the config
  code so that it doesn't fail when the profile does not exist -- allows
  sync'ing without a tree like it should. Parser returns an exception with
  the parse error now for getconfig(). TGL's patch for another cache issue
  in class config. Modified the /etc/make.profile message. Fix for the
  "eclass does not exist" messages on sync.

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Fix the repopath
  so that it cna be run outside of cvs repos. 

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Add portage's
  pym path to SANDBOX_PREDICT to stunt any further .pyc/.pyo problems. Add
  nofetch to the 'successful' kill list to stop the $T definition woes.

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: repoman should
  read each arch virtual file. This should close #40813.

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed -s/-S 
  bug. "Latest version installed:" was incorrect. This should fix #40847

  08 Feb 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed ldconfig
  bug. emerge didn't ldconfig after removing library directory.
  This should fix #40694.

*portage-2.0.50 (06 Feb 2003): Release -- API change, cleanups, speedups

  06 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: repoman got a quick fix
  from genone. Ed's fix for ask/pretend. Made sure that emerge force-updated
  the eclass cache before trying to update all the metadata. masking type
  patch from Genone. masking info patch and regenworld patch added.

*portage-2.0.50_pre22 (04 Feb 2003): Cleanups and stablizing

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: TGL's fixes
  for exec/child/wait problems. Unset GREP_OPTIONS GREP_COLOR. has() and use()
  no longer attempt to determine if they are to be quiet or noisy -- They
  default to noisy -- useq() and hasq() are the non-verbose versions.
  EBUILD_PHASE set to add a hack-ish way around global scope calls in
  eclasses -- NOTHING SHOULD BE CALLED IN THE GLOBAL SCOPE. Touchup to the
  inherit() code that should finally allow the removal of the ECLASS and
  INHERITED settings. Removed tty (use/has) calls. Removed dirname calls --
  portage.py handles setting the dbkey filename now.
  
  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Ed Catmur's
  (with a  little TGL added in) patch for --ask. Added a 'metadata' target
  that skips the sync and only updates the cache. FEATURES="getbinpkg" added.
  TGL's exit code fixes. Fixed match code for -S so it doesn't complain about
  specific and double versions. Unmerge via dbpath fix. Rewrote rsync's
  options that supports --verbose and --quiet operation now and can force
  checksumming all files using --debug. Sort the files in the cache update
  so it's a little more predictable. 

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: changed 
  --strip-debug to --strip-unneeded.

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Updates to
  enable HTTP/HTTPS authentication.

  04 Feb 04; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: best_from_dict
  added to grab the best entry from set of dicts using a list of the keys for
  priority. jstubb's patch to fix listdir -- splits it into a cache and list
  setup. jstubb's patch for varexpand to handle $VAR better. Latexer's patch
  for KernelVersion code to use Makefiles instead of the version.h. Modules
  are loaded from /etc/portage/modules or defaults, whichever works. Fixed
  the /etc/make.profile-is-missing traceback. Spawn can be given 3 pipes to
  redirect stdin,stdout,stderr to specific outputs, terminals, or files.
  TGL's patch for cache functions in portage.py so that they do not cache at
  inappropriate times. PORTAGE_TMPFS is now used if set as a temporary file
  operation area -- recommended to actually be a ramfs/tmpfs filesystem for
  speed. Genone enhanced the deprecated profile patch.

  31 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed --skipfirst
  bug. This closes #36880.

  29 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: TGL's patch
  for imporving overlay verbose. This closes #39765.

  27 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  autouse bug. autouse were ignored.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Output failed
  cache updates during emerge sync.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: VDB_PATH fixes.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only use
  custom profiles when not called by repoman. ROOT never changes profile
  roots, only custom/system profiles var/cache/edb/virtuals. Sandbox fix
  where sandbox was creating an invalid logfile (not giving a summary)
  due to a '/' in SANDBOX_LOG. Turned down the Lockfile output. Double
  check the INCOMPLETE MERGE identifications as it can be caused by cache.

  24 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved timestamp check 
  when 'emerge sync'. Added catching amiguous error when unmerge.
  This closes #24325.

  23 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py: Fixed 2 bugs. 
  Portage doesn't read local virtuals file, which happens on only cvs
  version. package is blocked by itself.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  Fix from genone for emerge's direct reading of packages and his patch
  that also adds in /etc/portage/profile as a stacked profile.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Completed
  inheritence capabilities for portage.config reading some files. Moved a
  copy of the getvirtuals() function into settings to handle multiple
  profiles properly.

*portage-2.0.50_pre17/18/19 (21 Jan 2004): Modules for DBs and quick fixes

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Moved all references
  to var/db/pkg to portage.VDB_PATH --- This will change again -- NEED TO
  BE MOVED INTO A PATH/CONSTANTS SETUP.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dosed: Quick fix for
  the basename missing/misplaced issue.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added
  /dev/console to PREDICT to attempt a workaround for a serial console
  bug. dbkey is now set through portage.py/doebuild to allow for modular
  db code.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: regen doesn't
  require root anymore. Edited the timestamp check to be a little more
  friendly -- delete the portdir timestamp and it won't use the alternate.
  Fix some permission settings. Added some warnings in for cachedirs that
  are very likely to ruin your system. Cleaned out some of the eclass code
  that isnt valid any longer.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portageq: Added vdb_path
  as a target to get the db directory. Quickpkg uses this.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  load_mod() -- grabs a class/function from a module and passes it back
  without loading the module into the global scope. Added unique_array()
  which eliminates duplicates from an array. grab_stacked() operates like
  the other grab* and getconfig functions, but takes a filename and a set
  of paths that it will apply incrementally or clobbers -- for profile
  inheritance. getconfig no longer exits on non-existance returns None.
  Class config now should be passed a profile path and a set of incremental
  values instead of using the globals -- defaults to using the globals
  presently and print an error message. Adding support for module configs
  as a set of strings 'class.subclass.objectmodule':'module.to.use.object'
  for load_mod and the database modules. Profile inheritance started. Killed
  the eclass() super-function and replaced it with class eclass_cache that
  is visible and conceptually simpler -- Also uses the plugable modules.
  Cleaned out the sync calls for the DBs. MASSIVE simplification of the
  aux_get code -- removed memory-caching in favor of system cache (actually
  faster in all cases so far -- P100 and P4-2.2G). Lockfile usage around the
  cachefile.
  
  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Updated
  the API a little but to have permissions set properly. A little more
  reorganization and removed the keycount checks.

  21 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: download size 
  should not be displayed when the package is nomerge with --tree.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reverted

  backing up the timestamp.chk fix.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved the
  list of --tree by TGL's patch. This should close #38070.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Removed debug
  message without --debug. This should close #23840.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved
  timestamp check of rsync. This should close #37403.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Improved
  regeneration ld.so.cache. This should close #37858.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which
  emerge doesn't block same package but different version.
  (example: DEPEND="!<cat/pkg-1.0.0" in cat/pkg-1.0.0.ebuild)

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Modified cpv_expand() to check package.mask. This should close #38592.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Escaped
  regualar expression for replace entry in fixdbentries().

  18 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fixed AUTOCLEAN delay problem in .50pre* by TGL's patch. This close 
  #38189. Fixed unmerge failture bug when 'ebuild foo-1.0.0 unmerge'.

  Fixed "ebuild /foo/bar-1.0.0.ebuild unmerge" and "emerge bar-1.0.0 unmerge" 
  problems. This should close #38420.

  "!<=" style block problem. Fixed symlink with absolute path 
  problem in treewalk().

  requests for unreasable usage of ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.
  
  11 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: A counter
  fix was fixed to actually check the counters of all CP versions to ensure
  the new counter is higher than all existing ones. Modified the dblink
  class to have class lockfiles for the db and tmpdb dirs as well as lock
  other files before editing. Reorganization of the merge code in dblink
  so that the tmpdb is filled immediately after preinst and prior to the
  actual FS merging -- COUNTER and CONTENTS go directly into the tmpdb
  and not into the infodir.
  
*portage-2.0.50_pre11/12 (09 Dec 2003): repoman/binpkg/exit conditions

  09 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: getbinpkgonly

  10 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Removed try()
  as it isn't used, and was deprecated for a long while. Genone's fetching
  size display added for --verbose. License display added. Added a little
  debug for IUSE so we can figure out the binary package --verbose IUSE
  issues that are randomly reported. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX's 'buildsyspkg'
  patch for building only system packages into tbz2s. Unmerge fix for new
  settings instances. RSYNC_RATELIMIT added.
  
  10 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: ADA path
  variables added to specials for env_update. Error messaeg correction for
  make.defaults syntax errors. Unmerge now uses the environment file, if it

  load_infodir() uses pkg settings completely now. Fixed the passing of
  settings in unmerge and dblink. Fixed an issue regarding unlinking lockfiles
  while inside of a sandbox.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh, *.sh:
  Moved helper scripts into bin/functions and made them sourceable -- they
  now will die in cases where sub-parts fail. dodoc and keepdir are now
  recursive-capable.

  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: emerge.log now
  set as portage:portage with 0660 perms. --debug now enables tracebacks
  for dep generation instead of moving code out of the try block.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> g-cpan.pl: rac's patch
  to get arch list from portage's list of arches in the profiles.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Moved a bit of

  01 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which 
  always remakes info dir file.

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed issue with

  lacking the "setting" argument for pkgmerge()

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed rsync bug.
  This closes bug #34660.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Migration
  to non-global settings started -- class config has new functionality and
  is locked after portage is finished initializing -- changes cannot be made
  to the global instance of config 'settings' -- reset() is now functional,
  setcpv() loads PKGUSE from /etc/portage/package.use, load_infodir() loads
  all small files (under 4k) from the vardb directory of an installed package
  so that operations have the same post* settings as they had at merge time.
  Begin modifications to spawn() to allow for files/pipes to be used for
  IO instead of using getstatusoutput which does not take an environment
  parameter like execve(). check_config_instance() ensures that the provided
  parameter is a 'class config' instance -- for ensuring that everything is
  being passed properly with the changes. Fix for the local FS mirror issue
  where it removed the first '/' instead of the last one. doebuild() cleanups
  for readability and pkguse enhancements -- also remove getstatusoutput()
  usage for depend so that we don't have to modify the active environment.
  Fix for symlink mtime values returned from movefile. (Nakano) SLOTMOVE
  added to global update functionality to fix some issues where a package
  suddenly must become slotted. portdbapi takes a root parameter instead
  of using settings. Slightly more useful output from depend. binarytree()
  now takes a pkgdir instead of using settings. Portage will now die if
  ebuild.sh exits on a signal.
  
  Moved some functions around and renamed them for general use -- derived
  from match2 in class portagetree:
  match_to_list() find all atoms in a list that match a given package.
  best_match_to_list() determines the most specific match. Needs work.
  match_from_list() find all packages in a list that match a given atom.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed an issue
  with searchdesc wanting root permissions if run as non-root. Migrated to
  the non-global config class. EMERGE_FROM added for the dyn_preinst patch
  -- Indicates if a merge is occuring from an ebuild or from a binary. Patch
  for rsync timestamp checking from Nakano.
  
  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Save PKGUSE.
  Pebeneto's patch for dyn_preinst and SELinux added as a fix for binary
  and ebuild merges. Added a kill for portage during the depend phase so
  that portage will actually die if you control-C.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: MASSIVE set of changes
  to start using locally defined 'class config' instances. This allows us to
  start working on some parallelism among other things. Created this way:
  mysettings = portage.config(clone=portage.settings)
  
  The Following functions now take a 'config' parameter:
  spawn(), fetch(), digestgen(), digestcheck(), spawnebuild(), doebuild(),
  merge(), dep_opconvert(), dep_check(), dblink.__init__()
  
  package.keywords is now implemented curtasy of genone/max. PKGUSE was
  rewritten for the global config killing and is also included. X11 man
  pages now found and zipped correctly. SYS.PATH fixes for the python
  migration -- issue actually only shows up on 2.2 systems because of how
  compiled modules are used if found regardless of the original source's
  existance.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> tabcheck.py: An easier
  way to make sure that all the python stuff is correctly using tabs and
  not mixing spaces.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> xpak, xpak.py: Fixes
  to ensure that it works if the current dir is missing and that the python
  path gets set properly.
  
  22 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  calls in vartree method to invalidentry().... made them call call
  self.dbapi.invalidentry() (there were multiple wrong method calls.)
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> md5check.py: Checks all
  digests and SRC_URIs for filenames and associated MD5s. Reports collisions
  between versions/packages, missing, and extra lines in digests.

*portage-2.0.49-r17/18 (10 Nov 2003): Fixes

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Changed portage to
  be the first path in sys.path for all python scripts. Also enabled
  optimizations from the scripts to ensure everything imported is built
  for speed. ebuild: applied fix for the '//' root breaking the db[].
  prepstrip: etdyn quickfix
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix for
  RESTRICT=nouserpriv. GENTOO_MIRRORS can have paths set to take files
  from. Fixes for mishandled cache data regarding *pkgsplit(). Fixes for
  '*' being returned as part of a package split. An 'invalidentry()' fix
  for a traceback. Nakano's fixes for virtual removals not working properly,
  sandbox violations during pkg_nofetch, || depend selection. Genone's
  fixpackages speedup.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: PORTAGE_TMPDIR
  fix for distcc. Variable passing bug patch for export_functions. Exit 1
  added for nofetch to stop sandbox violation. Nakano's --tree patch added.
  Improved the unmerge messages to denote what kind of unmerge fails. Info
  pages regex pattern adjusted to allow most any name for a page.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: genone's xml
  linting additions.

  01 Nov 2003; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py:
  fix bug #32071, by properly escaping a string to not be a regex. Checked
  thru entire *.py tree and found this is the only mis-use of strings that
  need to be escaped.

  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: /lib/modules
  now gets "unmerge protection." This is half of the config protection
  functionality. It means that anything in /lib/modules will not be deleted
  when a package is unmerged (often automatically when a user merges a
  kernel module ebuild for a new kernel.) This solves the "my module

  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: Should no longer
  spit out wacky "!!! no match found" warnings when auto-cleaning.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only run
  depscan.sh if it exists on disk. This allows Portage to run inside a stage1
  where /sbin/depscan.sh doesn't exist.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Applied fix to
  allow multi-level "use? (   )" in SRC_URI, closing bug #16159.

*portage-2.0.49-r15/16 (21 Oct 2003): Fixes

  for python2.3 -- fixed now.
  
  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  lockfiles to prelink md5 checks. Fixed caching bug where cache objects
