Release Notes; upgrade information mainly.
Features/major bugfixes are listed in NEWS

portage-2.1.2
==================================

* emerge does not necessarily update build time dependencies that are not
  strictly required.  See the --with-bdeps option in the emerge(1) man page.

portage-2.1.1
==================================

* emerge --search doesn't use regular expressions now anymore by default, so
  emerge --search dvd+rw-tools now works as expected. Regular expressions can be enabled
  by prefixing the search string with %. 
* emerge --depclean algorithm is much safer than the old one.
* emerge --newuse detects changes in IUSE that previously went undetected.

portage-2.1
==================================

* new cache framework, breaking all old cache modules.
  If you're having problems with portage_db_cdb, this is likely the cause.
* USE flag output ordering has changed.  The old ordering is now an option
  by the name of --alphabetical.  Adding the option to EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS
  in make.conf will restore the old behaviour permanently.
* The deprecated --inject has been removed, use /etc/portage/profile/package.provided
* The deprecated --upgradeonly has been removed, use /etc/portage/package.* 
  instead.
* 'emerge sync' has been deprecated, use 'emerge --sync' instead (same 
  for other actions)
* Tools that call emerge should override the EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS environment
  variable or use the emerge --ignore-default-opts option.
* rsync option handling has been redesigned, instead of RSYNC_* variables
  use PORTAGE_RSYNC_EXTRA_OPTS from now on.
* autouse (use.defaults) has been deprecated by specifying USE_ORDER in make.defaults
  Users may still turn this back on by specifying USE_ORDER="env:pkg:conf:auto:defaults"
  in make.conf.  Interested in figuring out what use flags were turned off?  Check out
  /usr/portage/profiles/base/use.defaults and other use.defaults files that correspond 
  to your profile.
