Release Notes for portage-2.2_pre1
==================================

New features / Major changes
----------------------------
* elog framework: This finally adds a flexible way to log all einfo, ewarn and
	eerror messages as well as adding a new elog command for ebuilds. New ebuilds
	should use elog instead of einfo for delivering important information as 
	einfo messages will not be logged by default. [genone]
* elog modules: Together with the framework some basic modules implementing
	common logging facilities are shipped, these include:
	- mod_syslog for relaying messages to syslog
	- mod_mail for sending messages to a predefined mail adress
	- mod_save for saving messages to a file
	- mod_custom for processing messages with a custom command
	NOTE: The elog interfaces are still subject to change, so don't rely on the
	exact format yet. [genone]
* version syntax enhancements: The version parsing and comparison code was 
	completely rewritten and now supports two extensions to previous versions:
	- a cvs prefix to denote live cvs (or svn or any other vcs) ebuilds, so now
		you can have a package foo with the ebuilds foo-1.ebuild and 
		foo-cvs.1.ebuild in the same directory. cvs ebuilds will always be 
		ranked higher than any non-cvs ebuild.
	- multiple suffixes now allow for constructions like foo-1.0_pre1_rc5
	[genone]
* recursive config files: Most of the config files in /etc/portage can now
	also be directories, if they are then portage will recursively use all
	files in them. So you could have /etc/portage/package.keywords/kde/base
	and /etc/portage/package.keywords/gnome instead of a single package.keywords.
	[genone]
* multi-hash support: digests and Manifests will now use SHA256 and RMD160 in
	addition to MD5 [genone]

Bug fixes / Minor Changes
