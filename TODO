Legend:
 '*' Enhancement        '#' Tricky Enhancement
 '!' Complicated        '@' Restricted in some way



# Determine file lock status before starting downloads -- Prevent races.
  Patches exist for this. Integrate and find all colliding descriptors.

* Add category support to searches... emerge -s @catgory

@ rsync - track changes based in subtrees to reduce filetree expense.
  Possible plans:
	  Use md5's of tree file list + md5 of subtree -- client-side burden.
		Maintain hash of changes on rsync1 -- Server-side burden. **
		Implement CVSUP. **
