 '*' Just do it.        '#' Tricky
 '!' Difficult          '@' Restricted in some way

# Repoman needs to ignore all user-set info in /etc/portage
# It's not relevant to deployed users and will probably be a general gotcha.

# Multiple rsync repos.
  bug 28796 -- Enable metadata caches for them. 

# STICKIES and related enhancements:
  bug 9379, bug 13616, Aether's config code

# Determine file lock status before starting downloads -- Prevent races/deletes
  Patches exist for this. Integrate and find all colliding descriptors/cmds.
  Create a fileIO layer? (wget and other external calls are a problem)

* Add category support to searches... emerge -s @catgory

@ rsync - track changes based in subtrees to reduce filetree expense.
  Possible plans:
    Use md5's of tree file list + md5 of subtree -- client-side burden.
    Maintain hash of changes on rsync1 -- Server-side burden. **
    Implement CVSUP. **

# 'emerge sync' timestamp awareness -- Make sure IP is associated and not
  used at random as servers may differ. bug 21794

! Rename all undocumented variables used in bash to prefixed values that
  are not easy to accidently duplicate. BUILDDIR --> PORTAGE_BUILDDIR or
  something like that. Prevent ebuilds from clobbering system variables.
