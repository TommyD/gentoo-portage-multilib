Legend:
 '*' Just do it.        '#' Tricky
 '!' Difficult          '@' Restricted in some way

# STICKIES and related enhancements:
  bug 9379, bug 13616, Aether's config code

# Determine file lock status before starting downloads -- Prevent races/deletes
  Patches exist for this. Integrate and find all colliding descriptors/cmds.
	Create a fileIO layer? (wget and other external calls are a problem)

* Add category support to searches... emerge -s @catgory

@ rsync - track changes based in subtrees to reduce filetree expense.
  Possible plans:
    Use md5's of tree file list + md5 of subtree -- client-side burden.
    Maintain hash of changes on rsync1 -- Server-side burden. **
    Implement CVSUP. **

# 'emerge sync' timestamp awareness -- Make sure IP is associated and not
  used at random as servers may differ. bug 21794
