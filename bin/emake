# emake: Supply some default parameters to GNU make. At the moment the
#        only parameter supplied is -jN, where N is a number of
#        parallel processes that should be ideal for the running host
#        (e.g. on a single-CPU machine, N=2).  The MAKEOPTS variable
#        is set in /etc/make.globals.  We don't source
#        /etc/make.globals here because emake is only called from an
#        ebuild.

exec env make ${MAKEOPTS} "$@"
