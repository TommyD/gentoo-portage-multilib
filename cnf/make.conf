# Build-time functionality
# ========================
#
# The USE variable is used to enable optional build-time functionality. For
# example, quite a few packages have optional X, gtk or GNOME functionality
# that can only be enabled or disabled at compile-time. Gentoo Linux has a
# very extensive set of USE variables described in our USE variable HOWTO at
# http://www.gentoo.org/doc/use-howto.html
# 
# Example:
#USE="X gtk gnome -alsa"

# Host Setting
# ============
#
# If you are using a Pentium Pro or greater processor, leave this line as-is;
# otherwise, change to i586, i486 or i386 as appropriate. All modern systems
# (even Athlons) should use "i686-pc-linux-gnu"

CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu"

# Host and optimization settings 
# ==============================
#
# For optimal performance, enable a CFLAGS setting appropriate for your CPU
#
# -mcpu=<cpu-type> means optimize code for the particular type of CPU without
# breaking compatibility with other CPUs.
#
# -march=<cpu-type> means to take full advantage of the ABI and instructions
# for the particular CPU; this will break compatibility with older CPUs (for
# example, -march=athlon-xp code will not run on a regular Athlon, and
# -march=i686 code will not run on a Pentium Classic.
#
# CPU types supported in gcc-3.2 and higher: athlon-xp, athlon-mp, athlon-4,
# athlon-tbird, athlon, duron, k6, k6-2, k6-3, i386, i486, i586 (Pentium), i686
# (Pentium Pro), pentium, pentium-mmx, pentiumpro, pentium2, pentium3, and
# pentium4. Note that Gentoo Linux 1.4 and higher include at least gcc-3.2.
# 
# CPU types supported in gcc-2.95*: k6, i386, i486, i586 (Pentium), i686
# (Pentium Pro), pentium, pentiumpro Gentoo Linux 1.2 and below use gcc-2.95*
#
# Decent examples:
#
#CFLAGS="-mcpu=athlon-xp -O3 -pipe"
#CFLAGS="-march=pentium3 -O3 -pipe"

# If you set a CFLAGS above, then this line will set your default C++ flags to
# the same settings. If you don't set a CFLAGS above, then comment this line out.
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

# Fetching files 
# ==============
#
# If you need to set a proxy for wget or lukemftp, add the appropriate "export
# ftp_proxy=<proxy>" and "export http_proxy=<proxy>" lines to /etc/profile if
# all users on your system should use them.
#
# Portage uses wget by default. Here are some settings for some alternate
# downloaders -- note that you need to merge these programs first before they
# will be available.
#
# Lukemftp (BSD ftp):
#FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -R -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE}
\${URI}"
#
# Prozilla (turbo downloader)
#FETCHCOMMAND='/usr/bin/proz --no-getch -s ${URI} -P ${DISTDIR}'
