# Build-time functionality
# ========================
#
# The USE variable is used to enable optional build-time functionality. For
# example, quite a few packages have optional X, gtk or GNOME functionality
# that can only be enabled or disabled at compile-time. Gentoo Linux has a
# very extensive set of USE variables described in our USE variable HOWTO at
# http://www.gentoo.org/doc/use-howto.html
#
# The available list of use flags with descriptions is in your portage tree.
# Use 'less' to view them:  --> less /usr/portage/profiles/use.desc <--
#
# 'ufed' is an ncurses/dialog interface available in portage to make handling
# useflags for you. 'emerge app-admin/ufed'
#
# Example:
#USE="X gtk gnome -alsa"

# Host Setting
# ============
#
# All supported ARM platforms currently require this CHOST.
#
CHOST="armv4l-unknown-linux-gnu"

# Host and optimization settings 
# ==============================
#
# For optimal performance, enable a CFLAGS setting appropriate for your CPU.
#
# Please note that if you experience strange issues with a package, it may be
# due to gcc's optimizations interacting in a strange way. Please test the
# package (and in some cases the libraries it uses) at default optimizations
# before reporting errors to developers.
#
# -mcpu=<cpu-type> means optimize code for the particular type of CPU without
# breaking compatibility with other CPUs.
#
# -march=<cpu-type> means to take full advantage of the ABI and instructions
# for the particular CPU; this will break compatibility with older CPUs (for
# example, -march=xscale code will not run on a StrongARM 11x0, and
# -march=strongarm110 code will not run on a StrongARM 110 (NetWinder).
#
# Don't use -O3. Even -O2 may be risky
#
# CPU types supported in gcc-3.2 and higher: 
# 
# CPU types supported in gcc-2.95*: 
#
# Decent examples:
#
# The defaults will support the Netwinder safely
#CFLAGS="-mcpu=strongarm110 -O2 -pipe"

# If you set a CFLAGS above, then this line will set your default C++ flags to
# the same settings.
#CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

# Advanced Masking
# ================
#
# Gentoo is using a new masking system to allow for easier stability testing
# on packages. KEYWORDS are used in ebuilds to mask and unmask packages based
# on the platform they are set for. A special form has been added that
# indicates packages and revisions that are expected to work, but have not yet
# been approved for the stable set. '~arch' is a superset of 'arch' which
# includes the unstable, in testing, packages. Users of the 'x86' architecture
# would add '~x86' to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS to enable unstable/testing packages.
# '~ppc', '~sparc', '~sparc64' are the unstable KEYWORDS for their respective
# platforms. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING BUT YOUR SPECIFIC ~ARCHITECTURE IN THE LIST.
# IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF YOUR ARCH, OR THE IMPLICATIONS, DO NOT MODIFY THIS.
#
#ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch"

# Portage Directories
# ===================
#
# Each of these settings controls an aspect of portage's storage and file
# system usage. If you change any of these, be sure it is available when
# you try to use portage. *** DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING "/" ***
#
# PORTAGE_TMPDIR is the location portage will use for compilations and
#     temporary storage of data. This can get VERY large depending upon
#     the application being installed.
#PORTAGE_TMPDIR=/var/tmp
#
# PORTDIR is the location of the portage tree. This is the repository
#     for all profile information as well as all ebuilds. This directory
#     itself can reach 200M. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND that you change this.
#PORTDIR=/usr/portage
#
# DISTDIR is where all of the source code tarballs will be placed for
#     emerges. The source code is maintained here unless you delete
#     it. The entire repository of tarballs for gentoo is 9G. This is
#     considerably more than any user will ever download. 2-3G is
#     a large DISTDIR.
#DISTDIR=${PORTDIR}/distfiles
#
# PKGDIR is the location of binary packages that you can have created
#     with '--buildpkg' or '-b' while emerging a package. This can get
#     upto several hundred megs, or even a few gigs.
#PKGDIR=${PORTDIR}/packages
#
# PORT_LOGDIR is the location where portage will store all the logs it
#     creates from each individual merge. They are stored as YYMMDD-$PF.log
#     in the directory specified. This is disabled until you enable it by
#     providing a directory. Permissions will be modified as needed.
#PORT_LOGDIR=/var/log/emerge
#
# PORTDIR_OVERLAY is a directory where local ebuilds may be stored without
#     concern that they will be deleted by rsync updates. Default is not
#     defined.
#PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage

# Fetching files 
# ==============
#
# If you need to set a proxy for wget or lukemftp, add the appropriate "export
# ftp_proxy=<proxy>" and "export http_proxy=<proxy>" lines to /etc/profile if
# all users on your system should use them.
#
# Portage uses wget by default. Here are some settings for some alternate
# downloaders -- note that you need to merge these programs first before they
# will be available.
#
# Default fetch command (5 tries, passive ftp for firewall compatibility)
#FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget -t 5 --passive-ftp \${URI} -P \${DISTDIR}"
#RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget -c -t 5 --passive-ftp \${URI} -P \${DISTDIR}"
#
# Using wget, ratelimiting downloads
#FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget -t 5 --passive-ftp \${URI} -P \${DISTDIR}"
#RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget -c -t 5 --passive-ftp --limit-rate=200k \${URI} -P \${DISTDIR}"
#
# Lukemftp (BSD ftp):
#FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -R -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#
# Prozilla (turbo downloader)
#FETCHCOMMAND='/usr/bin/proz --no-getch -s ${URI} -P ${DISTDIR}'
#
# Portage uses GENTOO_MIRRORS to specify mirrors to use for source retrieval.
# The list is a space seperated list which is read left to right. If you use
# another mirror we highly recommend leaving the default mirror at the end of
# the list so that portage will fall back to it if the files cannot be found
# on your specified mirror. We _HIGHLY_ recommend that you change this setting
# to a nearby mirror by merging and using the 'mirrorselect' tool.
#GENTOO_MIRRORS="<your_mirror_here> http://gentoo.oregonstate.edu/ http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo"

# Advanced Features
# =================
#
# MAKEOPTS provides extra options that may be passed to 'make' when a
#     program is compiled. Presently the only use is for specifying
#     the number of parallel makes (-j) to perform. The suggested number
#     for parallel makes is CPUs+1.
#MAKEOPTS="-j2"
#
# AUTOCLEAN enables portage to automatically clean out older or overlapping
#     packages from the system after every successful merge. This is the
#     same as running 'emerge -c' after every merge. Set with: "yes" or "no".
#     This does not affect the unpacked source. See 'noclean' below.
#AUTOCLEAN="yes"
#
# FEATURES are settings that affect the functionality of portage. Most of
#     these settings are for developer use, but some are available to non-
#     developers as well. 'buildpkg' is an always-on setting for the emerge
#     flag of the same name. It causes binary packages to be created of all
#     packages that are merged. 'distcc' enables distcc support for via CC.
#     'userpriv' allows portage to drop root privleges while it is compiling
#     as a security measure, and as a side effect this can remove sandbox
#     access violations for users. 'usersandbox' enables sandboxing while
#     portage is running under userpriv. 'noclean' prevents portage from
#     removing the source and temporary files after a merge -- for debugging
#     purposes only. 'noauto' is a feature which causes ebuild to perform
#     the action requested and not any other required actions like clean or
#     unpack -- for debugging purposes only. 'cvs' is a feature for developers
#     that causes portage to enable full settings and USE flags in SRC_URI and
#     has wide effects -- don't set this unless you're ready for it. 'keeptemp'
#     prevents the clean phase from deleting the temp files ($T) from a merge.
#FEATURES="sandbox buildpkg ccache distcc userpriv usersandbox noclean noauto cvs keeptemp"
#
# CCACHE_SIZE sets the space use limitations for ccache. The default size is
#     2G, and will be set if not defined otherwise and ccache is in features. 
#     Portage will set the default ccache dir if it is not present in the
#     user's environment: ${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/ccache (/var/tmp/ccache).
#     Sizes are specified with 'G' 'M' or 'K'.
#     '4G' for 4 gigabytes, '4096M' for 4 gigabytes, etc... Default is 2G
#CCACHE_SIZE="2G"
#
# RSYNC_RETRIES sets the number of times portage will attempt to retrieve
#     a current portage tree before it exits with an error. This allows
#     for a more successful retrieval without user intervention most times.
#RSYNC_RETRIES="3"
#
# RSYNC_TIMEOUT sets the length of time rsync will wait before it times out
#     on a connection. Most users will benefit from this setting as it will
#     reduce the amount of 'dead air' they experience when they run across
#     the occasional, unreachable mirror. Dialup users might want to set this
#     value up around the 300 second mark.
#RSYNC_TIMEOUT=180
#
# RSYNC_EXCLUDEFROM is a file that portage will pass to rsync when it updates
#     the portage tree. Specific chucks of the tree may be excluded from
#     consideration. This may cause dependency failures if you are not careful.
#     The file format is one pattern per line, blanks and ';' or '#' lines are
#     comments. See 'man rsync' for more details on the exclude-from format.
#RSYNC_EXCLUDEFROM=/etc/portage/rsync_excludes
