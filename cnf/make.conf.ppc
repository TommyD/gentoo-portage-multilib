# Build-time functionality
# ========================
#
# The USE variable is used to enable optional build-time functionality. For
# example, quite a few packages have optional X, gtk or GNOME functionality
# that can only be enabled or disabled at compile-time. Gentoo Linux has a
# very extensive set of USE variables described in our USE variable HOWTO at
# http://www.gentoo.org/doc/use-howto.html
# 
# Example:
#USE="X gtk gnome -alsa"

# Host Setting
# ============
#
# All PowerPC systems should use this host setting:

CHOST="powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu"

# Host and optimization settings 
# ==============================
#
# For optimal performance, enable a CFLAGS setting appropriate for your CPU
#
# -mcpu=<cpu-type> for PowerPC systems selects the type of processor you want
# to optimize your code for.   Code generated under those options will run best
# on that processor, and may not run at all on others.
#
# GCC 3.2 supports many powerpc processor types including:  rios, rios1, rsc,
# rios2, rs64a, 601, 602, 603, 603e, 604, 604e, 620, 630, 740, 7400, 7450, 750,
# power, power2, powerpc, 403, 505, 801, 821, 823, and 860 and common.
#
# GCC 2.95.3 lists these processor types as well, but only makes the
# distinction between pre G3 and G3 or better processors, whereas GCC 3.2 makes
# much finer distinctions.
#
# Testing has shown that -mcpu should not be used an any pre G3 processors for
# either gcc 2.95.3 or gcc 3.2.
#
# Recommended settings for GCC 3.2 only (Gentoo 1.4 or newer) :
#
# -maltivec enables optional (still limited) altivec support and should be used
# only for G4 processors,  on GCC 3.2 or newer.  It also requires that you have
# the alitvec option compiled into your kernel to take full advantage of this
# feature.
#
# Long term testing has shown that -O3 opts are unreliable on G4's but work
# on G3 series processors. Use on a G4 at your own risk =)
#
# Optimized for G4; "cat /proc/cpuinfo" to get your CPU model number and
# substitute it for the "7400" below (could be "7400", "7450"):
# Due to some failures with the cpu string of 7450, the dev team recommends 
# using -mcpu=7400 for all G4 series processors until GCC 3.2 is more mature
#
#CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -mcpu=7400 -maltivec -mabi=altivec -mpowerpc-gfxopt -fsigned-char"
#
# Optimized for G3; "cat /proc/cpuinfo" to get your CPU model number and
# substitute it for the "750" below (may not be necessary to change this number
# but is safe):
#
#
#CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -mcpu=750 -mpowerpc-gfxopt -fsigned-char"
#
# All other processors should use these options (don't use -mcpu) these should
# be safe for all processors and build generic code that will run on all PPC's,
# if you use BootX to boot you should probably select this option
#
#CFLAGS="-02 -pipe -fsigned-char"

# Recommended settings for GCC 2.95.3 only (Gentoo 1.2 or older):
#
# PowerPC 750 > up: this works on G3's and G4s, gcc 2.95.3 doesn't make the
# distinction between G3 and G4, so this is fine for all NewWorld machines, if
# you use yaboot to boot you should select this option
#
#CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -mcpu=750 -mpowerpc-gfxopt -mmultiple -mstring"
#
# This will run on all other processors, by building more generic code This is
# safe for all PPC machines running gcc 2.95.3, and works for all OldWorld
# machines - if you use BootX to boot you should select this option
#CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -mmultiple -mstring"

# If you set a CFLAGS above, then this line will set your default C++ flags to
# the same settings. If you don't set a CFLAGS above, then comment this line out.
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

# Fetching files 
# ==============
#
# If you need to set a proxy for wget or lukemftp, add the appropriate "export
# ftp_proxy=<proxy>" and "export http_proxy=<proxy>" lines to /etc/profile if
# all users on your system should use them.
#
# Portage uses wget by default. Here are some settings for some alternate
# downloaders -- note that you need to merge these programs first before they
# will be available.
#
# Lukemftp (BSD ftp):
#FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#RESUMECOMMAND="usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -R -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#
# Prozilla (turbo downloader)
#FETCHCOMMAND='/usr/bin/proz --no-getch -s ${URI} -P ${DISTDIR}'
