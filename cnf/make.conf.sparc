# Build-time functionality
# ========================
#
# The USE variable is used to enable optional build-time functionality. For
# example, quite a few packages have optional X, gtk or GNOME functionality
# that can only be enabled or disabled at compile-time. Gentoo Linux has a
# very extensive set of USE variables described in our USE variable HOWTO at
# http://www.gentoo.org/doc/use-howto.html
#
# The available list of use flags with descriptions is in your portage tree.
# Use 'less' to view them:  --> less /usr/portage/profiles/use.desc <--
#
# 'ufed' is an ncurses/dialog interface available in portage to make handling
# useflags for you. 'emerge app-admin/ufed'
#
# Example:
#USE="X gtk gnome -alsa"

CHOST="sparc-unknown-linux-gnu"

# Host and optimization settings 
# ==============================
#
# For optimal performance, enable a CFLAGS setting appropriate for your CPU
#
# Sparc specific cpu optimizatiobn flags can be found here:
# http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/SPARC-Options.html#SPARC%20Options
# 
# -mcpu=<cpu-type> means optimize code for the particular type of CPU without
# breaking compatibility with other CPUs.
#
# -mtune=<cpu-type> set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine, but
# do not set the instruction set or register set.
#
# SPARC CPU types supported in gcc-3.2 and higher:
#    v7:             cypress
#    v8:             supersparc, hypersparc
#    sparclite:      f930, f934, sparclite86x
#    sparclet:       tsc701
#    v9:             ultrasparc
#
# Decent examples:
#
#CFLAGS="-mcpu=supersparc -O3 -pipe"
#CFLAGS="-mcpu=ultrasparc -O3 -pipe"
#CFLAGS="-mcpu=v8 -mtune=v9 -O2 -pipe"

# If you set a CFLAGS above, then this line will set your default C++ flags to
# the same settings. If you don't set CFLAGS above, then comment this line out.
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

# Advanced Masking
# ================
#
# Gentoo is using a new masking system to allow for easier stability testing
# on packages. KEYWORDS are used in ebuilds to mask and unmask packages based
# on the platform they are set for. A special form has been added that
# indicates packages and revisions that are expected to work, but have not yet
# been approved for the stable set. '~arch' is a superset of 'arch' which
# includes the unstable, in testing, packages. Users of the 'x86' architecture
# would add '~x86' to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS to enable unstable/testing packages.
# '~ppc', '~sparc', 'sparc64' are the unstable KEYWORDS for their respective
# platforms. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING BUT YOUR SPECIFIC ~ARCHITECTURE IN THE LIST.
# IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF YOUR ARCH, OR THE IMPLICATIONS, DO NOT MODIFY THIS.
#
#ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~sparc"

# Portage Directories
# ===================
#
# Each of these settings controls an aspect of portage's storage and file
# system usage. If you change any of these, be sure it is available when
# you try to use portage. *** DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING "/" ***
#
# PORTAGE_TMPDIR is the location portage will use for compilations and
#     temporary storage of data. This can get VERY large depending upon
#     the application being installed.
#PORTAGE_TMPDIR=/var/tmp
#
# PORTDIR is the location of the portage tree. This is the repository
#     for all profile information as well as all ebuilds. This directory
#     itself can reach 200M. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND that you change this.
#PORTDIR=/usr/portage
#
# DISTDIR is where all of the source code tarballs will be placed for
#     emerges. The source code is maintained here unless you delete
#     it. The entire repository of tarballs for gentoo is 9G. This is
#     considerably more than any user will ever download. 2-3G is
#     a large DISTDIR.
#DISTDIR=${PORTDIR}/distfiles
#
# PKGDIR is the location of binary packages that you can have created
#     with '--buildpkg' or '-b' while emerging a package. This can get
#     upto several hundred megs, or even a few gigs.
#PKGDIR=${PORTDIR}/packages
#
# PORT_LOGDIR is the location where portage will store all the logs it
#     creates from each individual merge. They are stored as YYMMDD-$PF.log
#     in the directory specified. This is disabled until you enable it by
#     providing a directory. Permissions will be modified as needed.
#PORT_LOGDIR=/var/log/emerge
#
# PORTDIR_OVERLAY is a directory where local ebuilds may be stored without
#     concern that they will be deleted by rsync updates. Default is not
#     defined.
#PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage

# Fetching files 
# ==============
#
# If you need to set a proxy for wget or lukemftp, add the appropriate "export
# ftp_proxy=<proxy>" and "export http_proxy=<proxy>" lines to /etc/profile if
# all users on your system should use them.
#
# Portage uses wget by default. Here are some settings for some alternate
# downloaders -- note that you need to merge these programs first before they
# will be available.
#
# Lukemftp (BSD ftp):
#FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/lukemftp -s -a -R -o \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE} \${URI}"
#
# Prozilla (turbo downloader)
#FETCHCOMMAND='/usr/bin/proz --no-getch -s ${URI} -P ${DISTDIR}'
#
# Portage uses GENTOO_MIRRORS to specify mirrors to use for source retrieval.
# The list is a space seperated list which is read left to right. If you use
# another mirror we highly recommend leaving the default mirror at the end of
# the list so that portage will fall back to it if the files cannot be found
# on your specified mirror. We _HIGHLY_ recommend that you change this setting
# to a nearby mirror using the 'mirrorselect' tool in portage.
#GENTOO_MIRRORS="<your_mirror_here> http://gentoo.oregonstate.edu/ http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo"

# Advanced Features
# =================
#
# MAKEOPTS provides extra options that may be passed to 'make' when a
#     program is compiled. Presently the only use is for specifying
#     the number of parallel makes (-j) to perform. The suggested number
#     for parallel makes is CPUs+1.
#MAKEOPTS="-j2"
#
# AUTOCLEAN enables portage to automatically clean out older or overlapping
#     packages from the system after every successful merge. This is the
#     same as running 'emerge -c' after every merge. Set with: "yes" or "no".
#AUTOCLEAN="yes"
#
# FEATURES are settings that affect the functionality of portage. Most of
#     these settings are for developer use, but some are available to non-
#     developers as well. 'buildpkg' is an always-on setting for the emerge
#     flag of the same name. It causes binary packages to be created of all
#     packages that are merged. 'distcc' enables distcc support for via CC.
#FEATURES="sandbox ccache buildpkg distcc"
#
# RSYNC_RETRIES sets the number of times portage will attempt to retrieve
#     a current portage tree before it exits with an error. This allows
#     for a more successful retrieval without user intervention most times.
#RSYNC_RETRIES="3"
