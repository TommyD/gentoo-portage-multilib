.SH NAME
repoman \- Gentoo's program to enforce a minimal level of quality assurance in packages added to the portage tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrepoman\fR [\fIoption\fR] [\fImode\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR "Quality is job zero."

.BR repoman
is meant for Gentoo developers only due to the fact it does not work on a per-ebuild basis.
It checks the quality of CVS repositories.

Note: \fBrepoman commit\fR only works \fIinside local\fR CVS repositories.
