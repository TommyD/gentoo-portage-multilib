.TH "REPOMAN" "1" "Aug 2008" "Portage 2.2" "Portage"
.SH NAME
repoman \- Gentoo's program to enforce a minimal level of quality assurance in packages added to the portage tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrepoman\fR [\fIoption\fR] [\fImode\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR "Quality is job zero."

.BR repoman
checks the quality of ebuild repositories.

Note: \fBrepoman commit\fR only works \fIinside local\fR cvs, git, or subversion repositories.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--force\fR
Force commit to proceed, regardless of QA issues. For convenience, this option
causes the most time consuming QA checks to be skipped. The commit message will
include an indication that this option has been enabled, together with the
usual portage version stamp.

When used together with \fBmanifest\fR mode, \fB--force\fR causes existing
digests to be replaced for any files that exist in ${DISTDIR}.
Existing digests are assumed to be correct for files that would otherwise
have to be downloaded in order to recompute digests. \fBWARNING:\fR When
replacing existing digests, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that
files contained in ${DISTDIR} have the correct identities. Especially beware
of partially downloaded files.
