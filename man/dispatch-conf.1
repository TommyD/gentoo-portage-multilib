.SH NAME
dispatch-conf \- Sanely update configuration files after emerging new packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dispatch-conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dispatch-conf
is designed to be run after merging new packages in order to see if
there are updates to the configuration files.  If a new
configuration file will overwrite an old one, 
.I dispatch-conf 
will prompt the user for a decision about how to resolve the
discrepancy.  
Advantages of 
.I dispatch-conf
include easy rollback (changes to config files are stored either using
patches or rcs) and the ability to automatically update config files
that the user has never modified or 
that differ from the current version only in CVS cruft or white space.

.I dispatch-conf
will check all directories in the \fICONFIG_PROTECT\fR variable.  All
config files found in \fICONFIG_PROTECT_MASK\fR will automatically be
updated for you by \fIdispatch-conf\fR.  See \fBmake.conf\fR(5) for more
information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
None.
.SH USAGE
.I dispatch-conf
must be run as root, since the config files to be replaced are generally
owned by root.  Before running
.I dispatch-conf
for the first time the settings in 
.B /etc/dispatch-conf.conf
should be edited and the archive directory specified in 
\fI/etc/dispatch-conf.conf\fR will need to be created.  All changes to
config files will be saved in the archive directory either as patches
or using rcs, making restoration to an earlier version rather simple.

When dispatch-conf finds a config file that has a new update the user 
is provided
with a menu of options for how to handle the update:
.TP
.B u
Update (replace) the current config file with the new config file and continue.
.TP
.B z
Zap (delete) the new config file and continue.
.TP
.B n
Skip to the next config file, leaving both the original config file and any
\fICONFIG_PROTECT\fRed files.
.TP
.B e
Edit the new config file, using the editor defined in \fI$EDITOR\fR.
.TP
.B m
Interactively merge the current and new config files.
.TP
.B l
Look at the differences between the pre-merged and merged config files.
.TP
.B t
Toggle between the merged and pre-merged config files (in terms of which
should be installed using the 
.Qt u
command).
.TP
.B h
Display a help screen.
.TP
.B q
Quit
.I dispatch-conf.
