.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBemerge\fR is the definitive command\-line interface to the Portage
system.  It is primarily used for installing packages, and \fBemerge\fR
can automatically handle any dependencies that the desired package has.
\fBemerge\fR can also update the \fBportage tree\fR, making new and
updated packages available.  \fBemerge\fR gracefully handles updating
installed packages to newer releases as well.  It handles both source
and binary packages, and it can be used to create binary packages for
distribution.
.SH "EBUILDS, TBZ2S, CLASSES AND DEPENDENCIES"
\fBemerge\fR primarily installs packages.  You can specify
packages to install in one of four main ways: an \fIebuild\fR,
a \fItbz2file\fR, a \fIclass\fR, or a \fIdependency\fR.
.LP 
.TP
\fBebuild\fR
An \fIebuild\fR must be, at a minimum, a valid Portage
package directory name without a version or category, such as
\fBportage\fR or \fBpython\fR.
Both categories and version numbers may be used in addition, such
as \fBsys\-apps/portage\fR or \fB=python\-2.2.1\-r2\fR. \fBemerge\fR
ignores a trailing slash so that filename completion can be used.
The \fIebuild\fR may also be an actual filename, such as
\fB/usr/portage/app\-admin/python/python\-2.2.1\-r2.ebuild\fR.
.TP
\fBtbz2file\fR
A \fItbz2file\fR must be a valid .tbz2 created with \fBebuild
<package>\-<version>.ebuild package\fR or \fBemerge
\-\-buildpkg <package>\fR.
.TP
\fBclass\fR
Package classes are a convenient shorthand for large groups of
packages.  Two classes are currently supported: \fBsystem\fR
and \fBworld\fR.  \fBsystem\fR refers to a set of packages
deemed necessary for your system to run properly.  \fBworld\fR
contains all of the packages in \fBsystem\fR, along with any
other packages listed in \fB/var/cache/edb/world\fR. [See
\fBFILES\fR below for more information.]  Note that these
commands are generally used in conjunction with \fB\-\-update\fR.
.TP
\fBdependency\fR
A \fIdependency\fR describes bounds on a package that you wish
to install.  For example, \fB>=dev\-lang/python\-2.2.1\-r2\fR
matches the latest available version of Python greater than or equal
to 2.2.1\-r2.  Similarly, \fB<dev\-lang/python\-2.0\fR matches
the latest available version of Python before 2.0.  Note that in many
shells you will need to escape characters such as '<' and '=';
use single\- or double\-quotes around the \fIdependency\fR
to get around escaping problems.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.TP
\fBNo action\fR
If no action is specified, the action is to merge in the specified
packages, satisfying any dependencies that they may have.  The
arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR, \fItbz2s\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or
\fIdependencies\fR.  \fBNote that you need to use the\fR \-\-usepkg
\fBoption if you want to install a tbz2\fR.  The packages are added
to the \fBworld\fR file at the end, so that they are considered for
later updating.  
.TP
\fBclean\fR (\fB\-c\fR)
Cleans the system by removing packages that will not effect the
functionality of the system.  The arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR,
\fIclasses\fR, or \fIdependencies\fR.  For example, \fBemerge
clean binutils\fR cleans out old versions of binutils;
\fBemerge clean net\-www/mozilla\-0.9.9\-r2\fR cleans out that
specific version of Mozilla.  This is generally safe to use.
\fBNote that\fR clean \fBdoes not remove unslotted packages.\fR
.TP
\fBdepclean\fR
Determines all packages installed on the system that have no
explicit reason for being there.  \fBemerge\fR generates a list
of packages which it expects to be installed by checking the
\fBsystem\fR package list and the \fBworld\fR file.  It then
compares that list to the list of packages which are actually
installed; the differences are listed as unnecessary packages
and are suggested for unmerging. \fBWARNING: Removing some
packages may cause packages which link to the removed package
to stop working and complain about missing libraries.\fR
Re\-emerge the complaining package to fix this issue.
\fBNote that changes in USE flags can drastically affect the
output of depclean.\fR
.TP
\fBhelp\fR (\fB\-h\fR)
Displays help information for emerge.  Adding one of the additional
arguments listed above will give you more specific help information
on that subject.  The internal \fBemerge\fR help documentation is
updated more frequently than this man page; check it out if you
are having problems that this man page does not help resolve.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR
This is a list of information to include in bug reports which aids
the developers with fixing any problems you may report. \fBPlease
include this information when submitting a bug report.\fR Expanded
output can be obtained with the \fI--verbose\fR option.
.TP
\fBinject\fR (\fB\-i\fR)
Injecting a package inserts a 'stub' for that package so that Portage
thinks that it is installed. It is handy if you need, say, a binary
version of XFree86 for esoteric hardware, or you just like to roll
your own packages.  You \fBmust\fR specify a category and particular
version of a package for injecting.  For example,
\fBemerge inject sys\-kernel/gentoo\-sources\-2.4.19\fR.
.TP
\fBprune\fR (\fB\-P\fR)
\fBWARNING: This action can remove important packages!\fR Removes
all but the latest versions of matching packages.  If there are
multiple SLOTs for a package, it leaves the latest version in each
SLOT. This does no checking of dependencies, so it may remove
packages necessary for the proper operation of your system. \fBUse\fR
clean \fBinstead unless you really know what you're doing\fR.  Its
arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or \fIdependencies\fR
\-\- see \fBclean\fR above for examples.
.TP
\fBrsync\fR
See \fBsync\fR below.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR (\fB\-s\fR)
Searches for matches of the supplied string in the portage tree.
The search string is a regular expression.  For example, \fBemerge
search "^kde"\fR searches for any package that starts with "kde";
\fBemerge search "gcc$"\fR searches for any package that ends with
"gcc"; \fBemerge search "office"\fR searches for any package that
contains the word "office".  If you want to search the package
descriptions as well, use the \fB\-\-searchdesc\fR,\fB-S\fR option.
.TP
\fBsync\fR
Initiates a portage tree update with one of the rsync.gentoo.org
mirrors.  \fBNote that any changes you have made to the portage
tree will be erased\fR.  Except for in special circumstances,
this uses \fBrsync\fR to do the update. See make.conf's description
of PORTDIR_OVERLAY for a method to avoid deletions.
.TP
\fBunmerge\fR (\fB\-C\fR)
\fBWARNING: This action can remove important packages!\fR Removes
all matching packages.  This does no checking of dependencies, so
it may remove packages necessary for the proper operation of your
system. Its arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or
\fIdependencies\fR \-\- see \fBclean\fR above for examples.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Displays the version number of \fBemerge\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS "
.TP
\fB\-\-buildpkg\fR (\fB\-b\fR)
Tells emerge to build binary packages for all ebuilds processed in
addition to actually merging the packages.  Useful for maintainers
or if you administrate multiple Gentoo Linux systems (build once,
emerge tbz2s everywhere).  The package will be created in the
\fI${PKGDIR}\fR/All directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-columns\fR
Used along side \fI--pretend\fR to causes the package, new version,
and old version to be displayed in an aligned format for easy cut\-n\-paste.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR (\fB\-d\fR)
Tells emerge to run the emerge command in \-\-debug mode.  In this
mode the bash build environment will run with the \-x option,
causing it to output verbose debug information to stdout.
\-\-debug is great for finding bash syntax errors.
.TP
\fB\-\-deep\fR
When used in conjunction with \fB\-\-update\fR, this flag forces
\fBemerge\fR to consider the entire dependency tree of packages,
instead of checking only the immediate dependencies of the packages.
As an example, this catches updates in libraries that are not directly
listed in the dependencies of a package.
.TP
\fB\-\-emptytree\fR (\fB\-e\fR)
Virtually tweaks the tree of installed packages to only contain glibc;
this is great to use together with \-\-pretend. This allows developers
to get a complete overview of the complete dependency tree of a package,
and it enables complete trees to be rebuilt using the latest libraries.
.TP
\fB\-\-fetchonly\fR (\fB\-f\fR)
Instead of doing any package building, just perform fetches for all
packages (the main package as well as all dependencies.)
.TP
\fB\-\-noconfmem\fR
Causes portage to disregard merge records indicating that a config file
inside of a CONFIG_PROTECT directory has been merged already. Portage
will normally merge those files only once to prevent the user from
dealing with the same config multiple times. This flag will cause the
file to always be merged.
.TP
\fB\-\-nodeps\fR
Merges specified packages without merging any dependencies.  Note that
the build may fail if the dependencies aren't satisfied.
.TP
\fB\-\-noreplace\fR (\fB\-n\fR)
Skips the packages specified on the command\-line that have already
been installed.  Without this option, any packages, ebuilds, or deps
you specify on on the command\-line *will* cause Portage to remerge
the package, even if it is already installed. Note that Portage will
not remerge dependencies by default.
.TP
\fB\-\-nospinner\fR
Disables the spinner for the session. The spinner is active when the
terminal device is determined to be a TTY. This flag disables it regardless.
.TP
\fB\-\-oneshot\fR
Emerge as normal, but do not add the packages to the world profile
for later updating.
.TP
\fB\-\-onlydeps\fR (\fB\-o\fR)
Only merge (or pretend to merge) the dependencies of the packages
specified, not the packages themselves.
.TP
\fB\-\-pretend\fR (\fB\-p\fR)
Instead of actually performing the merge, simply display what *would*
have been installed if \-\-pretend weren't used.  Using \-\-pretend
is strongly recommended before installing an unfamiliar package. In
the printout, N = new, U = upgrading, R = replacing, B = blocked by
an already installed package.
.TP
\fB\-\-searchdesc\fR (\fB\-S\fR)
Matches the search string against the description field as well as
the package name.  \fBTake caution\fR as the descriptions are also
matched as regular expressions.
.TP
\fB\-\-update\fR (\fB\-u\fR)
Updates packages to the most recent version available.  \fBNote that\fR \-\-update \fBdoes not have full functionality yet\fR.  It will not automatically update dependencies of packages in the \fBworld\fR file, unless they too are in the \fBworld\fR file.
.TP
\fB\-\-usepkg\fR (\fB\-k\fR) 
Tells emerge to use binary packages (from $PKGDIR) if they are available, thus possibly avoiding some time\-consuming compiles. This option is useful for CD installs; you can export PKGDIR=/mnt/cdrom/packages and then use this option to have emerge "pull" binary packages from the CD in order to satisfy dependencies.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR (\fB\-v\fR)
Tell emerge to run in verbose mode.  Currently this flag causes emerge to print out GNU info errors, if any.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Displays the version number of \fBemerge\fR.  It cannot be used in
conjunction with other options; the name and format of the action
is a convention.
.SH "NOTES"
You should almost always precede any package install or update
attempt with a \fB\-\-pretend\fR install or update.  This lets
you see how much will be done, and shows you any blocking
packages that you will have to rectify.  This goes doubly so
for the \fBsystem\fR and \fBworld\fR classes, which can
update a large number of packages if the portage tree has
been particularly active.
.LP 
You also want to typically use \fB\-\-update\fR, which ignores
packages that are already fully updated but upgrades those that
are not.
.LP 
When you install a package with uninstalled dependencies and do
not explicitly state those dependencies in the list of parameters,
they will not be added to the world file.  If you want them to be
detected for world updates, make sure to explicitly list them as
parameters to \fBemerge\fR.
.LP 
\fBUSE variables\fR may be specified on the command line to
override those specified in the default locations, letting you
avoid using some dependencies you may not want to have.  \fBUSE
flags specified on the command line are NOT remembered\fR.  For
example, \fBUSE="\-x \-gnome" emerge mc\fR will emerge mc with
those USE settings.
.LP 
If \fBemerge \-\-update system\fR or \fB emerge \-\-update world\fR
fail with an error message, it may be that an ebuild uses some
newer feature not present in this version of \fBemerge\fR.  You
can use \fBemerge \-\-update portage\fR to upgrade to the lastest
version, which should support any necessary new features.
.SH "MASKED PACKAGES"
\fINOTE: Please use caution when using development packages. Problems
and bugs resulting from misusing masked packages drains Gentoo
developer time. Please be sure you are capable of handling problems
that may ensue.\fR
.LP 
Masks in \fBportage\fR provide three primary functions: they allow a
testing period where the packages can be used in live machines; they
prevent the use of a package when it will fail, and they mask existing
packages that are broken or could pose a security risk.  Masking can be
done by two methods: \fBpackage.mask\fR and KEYWORDS.
.TP
\fBpackage.mask\fR
\fBpackage.mask\fR primarily blocks the use of packages that cause
problems or are known to have issues on disparate systems. It resides in
\fI${PORTDIR}/profiles\fR. Packages may be unmasked in the file by adding
a comment character (\fB#\fR) to the beginning of the line which masks
the package.
.TP
\fBKEYWORDS\fR
KEYWORDS are also used for masking packages still in testing. There are
architecture\-specific keywords for each package that let \fBportage\fR
know which systems are compatible with the package.  Packages which
compile on an architecture, but have not been proven to be "stable",
are masked with a tilde (\fB~\fR) in front of the architecture name.
\fBemerge\fR examines the \fBACCEPT_KEYWORDS\fR environment variable
to allow or disallow the emerging of a package masked by a KEYWORD.
To inform \fBemerge\fR that it should build these 'testing' versions
of packages, you may set \fBACCEPT_KEYWORDS\fR to "\fB~arch\fR", where
\fBarch\fR is one of \fBx86\fR, \fBppc\fR, \fBsparc\fR, \fBsparc64\fR,
or \fBalpha\fR.  For example, \fBACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge xfree\fR
will cause \fBemerge\fR to consider KEYWORDS\-masked versions of XFree
it decides the packages to build.  \fBWARNING:\fR Do \fInot\fR set this
variable to anything other than the value corresponding to your
architecture.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Please report any bugs you encounter through our website:
