.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBemerge\fR is the definitive command\-line interface to the Portage
system.  It is primarily used for installing packages, and \fBemerge\fR
can automatically handle any dependencies that the desired package has.
\fBemerge\fR can also update the \fBportage tree\fR, making new and
updated packages available.  \fBemerge\fR gracefully handles updating
installed packages to newer releases as well.  It handles both source
and binary packages, and it can be used to create binary packages for
distribution.
.SH "EBUILDS, TBZ2S, CLASSES AND DEPENDENCIES"
\fBemerge\fR primarily installs packages.  You can specify
packages to install in one of four main ways: an \fIebuild\fR,
a \fItbz2file\fR, a \fIclass\fR, or a \fIdependency\fR.
.LP 
.TP 
\fIebuild\fR
An \fIebuild\fR must be, at a minimum, a valid Portage
package directory name without a version or catetory, such as
\fBportage\fR or \fBpython\fR.
Both categories and version numbers may be used in addition, such
as \fBsys\-apps/portage\fR or \fBpython\-2.2.1\-r2\fR. \fBemerge\fR
ignores a trailing slash so that filename completion can be used.
The \fIebuild\fR may also be an actual filename, such as
\fB/usr/portage/app\-admin/python/python\-2.2.1\-r2.ebuild\fR.

.TP 
\fItbz2file\fR
A \fItbz2file\fR must be a valid .tbz2 created with \fBebuild
<package>\-<version>.ebuild package\fR or \fBemerge
\-\-buildpkg <package>.

.TP 
\fIclass\fI
Package classes are a convenient shorthand for large groups of
packages.  Two classes are currently supported: \fBsystem\fR
and \fBworld\fR.  \fBsystem\fR refers to a set of packages
deemed necessary for your system to run properly.  \fBworld\fR
contains all of the packages in \fBsystem\fR, along with any
other packages listed in \fB/var/cache/edb/world\fR. [See
\fBFILES\fR below for more information.]  Note that these
commands are generally used in conjunction with \fB\-\-update\fR.

.TP 
\fIdependency\fR
A \fIdependency\fR describes bounds on a package that you wish
to install.  For example, \fB>=dev\-lang/python\-2.2.1\-r2\fR
matches the latest available version of Python greater than or equal
to 2.2.1\-r2.  Similarly, \fB<dev\-lang/python\-2.0\fR matches
the latest available version of Python before 2.0.  Note that in many
shells you will need to escape characters such as '<' and '=';
use single\- or double\-quotes around the \fIdependency\fR
to avoid this.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.TP 
\fBNo action\fR
If no action is specified, the action is to merge in the specified packages, satisfying any dependencies
that they may have.  The arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR, \fItbz2s\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or
\fIdependencies\fR.  \fBNote that you need to use the\fR \-\-usepkg \fBoption if you want
to install a tbz2\fR.  The packages are added to the \fBworld\fR file at the end, so that they are
considered for later updating.  
.TP 
\fBclean\fR (\fB\-c\fR)
Cleans the system by removing packages that will not effect the functionality of the system.  The
arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or \fIdependencies\fR.  For example, \fBemerge
clean binutils\fR cleans out old versions of binutils; \fBemerge clean net\-www/mozilla\-0.9.9\-r2\fR
cleans out that specific version of Mozilla.  This is generally safe to use.
.TP 
\fBhelp\fR (\fB\-h\fR)
Displays help information for emerge.  Adding one of the additional arguments listed above will
give you more specific help information on that subject.  The internal \fBemerge\fR help
documentation is updated more frequently than this man page; check it out if you are having
problems that this man page does not help resolve.
.TP 
\fBinject\fR (\fB\-i\fR)
Injecting a package inserts a 'stub' for that package so that Portage thinks that it is installed.
It is handy if you need, say, a binary version of XFree86 for esoteric hardware, or you just like
to roll your own packages.  You \fBmust\fR specify a category and particular version of a package for injecting.  For
example, \fBemerge inject sys\-kernel/gentoo\-sources\-2.4.19\fR.
.TP 
\fBprune\fR (\fB\-P\fR)
\fBWARNING: This action can remove important packages!\fR Removes all but the latest versions of matching packages.  If there are multiple SLOTs for a package, it leaves the latest version in each SLOT.
This does no checking of dependencies, so it may remove packages necessary for the proper operation of your
system.  \fBUse\fR clean \fBinstead unless you really know what you're doing\fR.  Its arguments can be
\fIebuilds\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or \fIdependencies\fR\-\-see \fBclean\fR above for examples.
.TP 
\fBrsync\fR
See \fBsync\fR below.
.TP 
\fBsearch\fR (\fB\-s\fR)
Searches for matches of the supplied string in the portage tree.  The search string is a regular expression.  For example, \fBemerge search "^kde"\fR searches
for any package that starts with "kde"; \fBemerge search "gcc$"\fR searches for any package that ends with
"gcc"; \fBemerge search "office"\fR searches for any package that contains the word "office".  If you want to search the package descriptions as well, use the \fB\-\-searchdesc\fR option.
.TP 
\fBsync\fR
Initiates a portage tree update with one of the rsync.gentoo.org mirrors.  \fBNote that any changes
you have made to the portage tree will be erased\fR.  It is generally a good idea to use \fBsync\fR with
the \fB\-\-clean\fR option, as that gets rid of stale files that are no longer considered pertinent.
Except for in special circumstances, this uses \fBrsync\fR to do the update.
.TP 
\fBunmerge\fR (\fB\-C\fR)
\fBWARNING: This action can remove important packages!\fR Removes all matching packages.  This does
no checking of dependencies, so it may remove packages necessary for the proper operation of your system.
Its arguments can be \fIebuilds\fR, \fIclasses\fR, or \fIdependencies\fR\-\-see \fBclean\fR above
for examples.
.TP 
\fB\-\-version\fR
Displays the version number of \fBemerge\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS "
.TP 
\fB\-\-autoclean\fR (\fB\-a\fR)
\fBemerge\fR normally cleans out the package\-specific temporary build directory before it starts the building a package.  With \-\-autoclean, it will also clean the directory *after* the build completes.  This option is automatically enabled for normal users, but maintainers can use this option to enable autocleaning.
.TP 
\fB\-\-buildpkg\fR (\fB\-b\fR)
Tells emerge to build binary packages for all ebuilds processed in addition to actually merging the packages.  Useful for maintainers or if you administrate multiple Gentoo Linux systems (build once, emerge tbz2s everywhere).  The package will be created in the \fI${PKGDIR}\fR/All directory.
.TP 
\fB\-\-debug\fR (\fB\-d\fR)
Tells emerge to run the emerge command in \-\-debug mode.  In this mode the bash build environment will run with the \-x option, causing it to output verbose debug information to stdout.  \-\-debug is great for finding bash syntax errors.
.TP 
\fB\-\-emptytree\fR (\fB\-e\fR)
Virtually tweaks the tree of installed packages to only contain glibc; this is great to use together with \-\-pretend. This allows developers to get a complete overview of the complete dependency tree of a package, and it enables complete trees to be rebuilt using the latest libraries.
.TP 
\fB\-\-fetchonly\fR (\fB\-f\fR)
Instead of doing any package building, just perform fetches for all packages (the main package as well as all dependencies.)
.TP 
\fB\-\-nodeps\fR
Merges specified packages without merging any dependencies.  Note that the build may fail if the dependencies aren't satisfied.
.TP 
\fB\-\-noreplace\fR (\fB\-n\fR)
Skips the packages specified on the command\-line that have already been installed.  Without this option, any packages, ebuilds, or deps you specify on on the command\-line *will* cause Portage to remerge the package, even if it is already installed. Note that Portage will not remerge dependencies by default.
.TP 
\fB\-\-oneshot\fR
Emerge as normal, but do not add the packages to the world profile for later updating.
.TP 
\fB\-\-onlydeps\fR (\fB\-o\fR)
Only merge (or pretend to merge) the dependencies of the packages specified, not the packages themselves.
.TP 
\fB\-\-pretend\fR (\fB\-p\fR)
Instead of actually performing the merge, simply display what *would* have been installed if \-\-pretend weren't used.  Using \-\-pretend is strongly recommended before installing an unfamiliar package.  In the printout, N = new, U = upgrading, R = replacing, B = blocked by an already installed package.
.TP 
\fB\-\-searchdesc\fR (\fB\-S\fR)
Matches the search string against the description field as well as the package name.  \fBTake caution\fR as the descriptions are also matched as regular expressions.
.TP 
\fB\-\-update\fR (\fB\-u\fR)
Updates packages to the most recent version available.  \fBNote that\fR \-\-update \fBdoes not have full functionality yet\fR.  It will not automatically update dependencies of packages in the \fBworld\fR file, unless they too are in the \fBworld\fR file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-usepkg\fR (\fB\-k\fR) 
Tells emerge to use binary packages (from $PKGDIR) if they are available, thus possibly avoiding some time\-consuming compiles. This option is useful for CD installs; you can export PKGDIR=/mnt/cdrom/packages and then use this option to have emerge "pull" binary packages from the CD in order to satisfy dependencies.
.TP 
\fB\-\-verbose\fR (\fB\-v\fR)
Tell emerge to run in verbose mode.  Currently this flag causes emerge to print out GNU info errors, if any.
.TP 
\fB\-\-version\fR
Displays the version number of \fBemerge\fR.  It cannot be used in conjunction with other options; the
name and format of the action is a convention.
.SH "NOTES"
You should almost always precede any package install or update
attempt with a \fB\-\-pretend\fR install or update.  This lets
you see how much will be done, and shows you any blocking
packages that you will have to rectify.  This goes doubly so
for the \fBsystem\fR and \fBworld\fR classes, which can
update a large number of packages if the portage tree has
been particularly active.
.LP 
You also want to typically use \fB\-\-update\fR, which ignores
packages that are already fully updated but upgrades those that
are not.
.LP 
When you install a package with uninstalled dependencies and do
not explicitly state those dependencies in the list of parameters,
they will not be added to the world file.  If you want them to be
detected for world updates, make sure to explicitly list them as
parameters to \fBemerge\fR.
.LP 
\fBUSE variables\fR may be specified on the command line to
override those specified in the default locations, letting you
avoid using some dependencies you may not want to have.  \fBUSE
flags specified on the command line are NOT remembered\fR.  For
example, \fBUSE="\-x \-gnome" emerge mc\fR will emerge mc with
those USE settings.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBebuild(1) ebuild(5) make.defaults(5) make.conf(5)\fR
.LP 
\fBpkglist(1) pkgsearch(1) chkcontents(1)\fR
.LP 
A number of helper applications reside in \fI/usr/lib/portage/bin\fR.
.LP 
The \fBgentoolkit\fR package contains useful scripts such as \fBqpkg\fR
(a package query tool) and \fBetc\-update\fR (a configuration file
updater/merger).
