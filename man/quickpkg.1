.TH "QUICKPKG" "1" "Jul 2003" "Portage 2.0.51" "Portage"
.SH NAME
quickpkg \- creates portage packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quickpkg <list of pkgs>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I quickpkg
can be utilized to quickly create a package for portage by
utilizing the files already on your filesystem.  This package
then can be emerged on any system.  To review syntax for 
emerging binary packages, review \fBemerge\fR(1).  The upside
of this process is that you don't have to wait for the package 
to unpack, configure, compile, and install before you can have 
the package ready to go.  The downside is that the package will 
contain the files that exist on your filesystem even if they have 
modified since they were first installed.
.br
The packages, after being created, will be placed in \fBPKGDIR\fR.  
This variable is defined in \fBmake.conf\fR(5) and defaults to 
/var/tmp/binpkgs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B <list of packages>
Each package in the list can be of two forms.  First you can
give it the full path to the installed entry in the virtual
database.  That is, /var/db/pkg/<CATEGORY>/<PKG-VERSION>/.  
The second form is a portage depend atom.  This atom is of
the same form that you would give \fBemerge\fR if you wanted 
to emerge something.  See \fBebuild\fR(5) for full definition.
