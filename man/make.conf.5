.TH "MAKE.CONF" "5" "October 24, 2002" "Portage 2.0.42" "portage"
.SH "NAME"
make.conf \- custom settings for Portage
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B /etc/make.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This file contains various variables that are used by Portage.
Portage will check the currently\-defined environment variables
first for any settings.  If no environment settings are found,
Portage then checks /etc/make.conf.  If no setting is found
in /etc/make.conf, Portage checks /etc/make.profile/make.defaults.
If no setting is found there, the default setting is grabbed
from /etc/make.globals.  Please note that all user settings
should be made in the environment or in /etc/make.conf, which
is intended to be customized by the user.
.BR 
Exceptions are incremental variables such as USE, CONFIG_PROTECT*,
and ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.  Incremental variables are propagated down from
make.defaults to make.globals to make.conf to the environment
settings.  Clearing these variables requires a clear\-all as in:
export USE="\-*"
.SH "VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBROOT\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Use \fBROOT\fR to specify the target root filesystem to be used for
merging packages or ebuilds.  Typically, you should set this setting
in the environment rather than in /etc/make.conf itself.  It's
typically used for creating new build images.
.br
Defaults to /.
.TP
\fBFEATURES\fR = \fI"buildpkg ccache cvs digest mirror noauto noclean sandbox"\fR
Defines actions portage takes by default.  These options should
not be changed by anyone but developers and/or maintainers.  'sandbox' is an important
part of \fBFEATURES\fR and should not be disabled by default.
.br
\fIbuildpkg\fR: binary packages will always be generated.
.br
\fIccache\fR: enable portage support for the ccache package.
.br
\fIcvs\fR: enable auto-commit files after emerging a package.
.br
\fIdigest\fR: autogenerate a digest for packages.
.br
\fImirror\fR: cause \fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR to always be run even if file exists in \fBDISDIR\fR.
.br
\fInoauto\fR: when utilizing \fBebuild\fR(1), only run the function requested.
.br
\fInoclean\fR: do not clean out the temp build directory before building the pkg.
.br
\fIsandbox\fR: enable sandbox-ing when running \fBemerge\fR(1) and \fBebuild(1)\fR.
.TP
\fBNOCOLOR\fR = \fI["true" | "false"]\fR
Defines if color should be disabled by default.
.br
Defaults to false.
.TP
\fBCLEAN_DELAY\fR = \fIinteger\fR
Determines how long the countdown delay will be after running `emerge clean`.
.br
Defaults to 5 seconds.
.TP
\fBAUTOCLEAN\fR = \fI["yes" | "no"]\fR
Automatically cleans the system by removing outdated packages which will not
remove functionalities or prevent your system from working.
.br
Defaults to no.
.TP
\fBUSE_ORDER\fR = \fI"env:conf:auto:defaults"\fR
Determines precedence for incrementing the setting of the USE variable.
The above setting will cause the environment (env) to override make.conf
(conf) to override auto generated values from merged packages (auto) to
override make.defaults (defaults).
.br
\fB***warning***\fR
.br
Do not modify this value unless you're a developer and you know what you're doing.
If you change this and something breaks, we will not help you fix it.
.br
Defaults to "env:conf:auto:defaults".
.TP
\fBPROXY HTTP_PROXY FTP_PROXY\fR = \fI[host:port]\fR
These vars are used if the sources must be downloaded from the
internet by \fBwget\fR(1).  They are only required if you use a proxy server
for internet access.  Either define \fIPROXY\fR or \fIPROXY_FTP\fR and \fIPROXY_HTTP\fR.
.TP
\fBGENTOO_MIRRORS\fR = \fI[URLs]\fR
Insert your list of local mirrors here.  These locations are used to
download files before the ones listed in the \fIebuild scripts\fR.
.TP
\fBSYNC\fR = \fI[RSYNC]\fR
Insert your list of local rsync mirrors here.  These rsync servers are used
to sync the local portage tree when `emerge rsync` is run.
.TP
\fBCHOST\fR
This variable is passed by the \fIebuild scripts\fR to the \fIconfigure\fR
step as \fI\-\-host=${CHOST}\fR.  This way you can force the build\-host.
.TP
\fBMAKEOPTS\fR
Use this variable if you want to use parallel make.  For example, if you
have a dual\-processor system, set this variable to "\-j2" or "\-j3" for 
enhanced build performance with many packages.  Suggested setting is #CPUs+1.
.TP
\fBCFLAGS CXXFLAGS\fR 
Use these variables to set the desired optimization/CPU instruction settings
for applications that you compile.  Nearly all ebuild files will take advantage
of your custom settings, resulting in a Gentoo Linux that is fully customized
to your specifications.  Please use sane settings as some packages will fail to
compile/run if the optimizations are too extreme.

.TP
\fBDEBUGBUILD\fR
If this is defined, binaries and libraries are not stripped before \fImerge\fR.
.TP
\fBUSE\fR = \fI[space delimited list of USE items]\fR
This variable contains options that control the build behavior of
several packages.  More information in \fBebuild\fR(5).  Possible USE values
can be found in \fI/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc\fR.
.TP
\fBACCEPT_KEYWORDS\fR = \fI[space delimited list of KEYWORDS]\fR
Enable testing of ebuilds that have not yet been deemed 'stable'.  Users of the 'x86'
architecture would set this to '~x86' while ppc users would set this to '~ppc'.
.br
Defaults to no value.
.TP
\fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR
This variable contains the command used for fetching package\-sources from
the internet.
.TP

This variable contains the command used for resuming package\-sources that
have been partially downloaded by the \fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR.
.TP
