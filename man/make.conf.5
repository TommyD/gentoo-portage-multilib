.TH make.conf "5" "December 2001" "portage 1.7.8" 
.SH NAME
ebuild \- manual page for make.defaults
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/make.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file contains various variables that are used by Portage.
Portage will check the currently-defined environment variables
first for any settings.  If no environment settings are found,
Portage then checks /etc/make.conf.  If no setting is found
in /etc/make.conf, Portage checks /etc/make.profile/make.defaults.
If no setting is found there, the default setting is grabbed
from /etc/make.globals.  Please note that all user settings
should be made in the environment or in /etc/make.conf, which
is intended to be customized by the user.
.PP
.SH VARIABLES
\fBROOT\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Use root to specify the target root filesystem to be used for
merging packages or ebuilds.  If unset, ROOT defaults to /.
Typically, you should set this setting in the environment
rather than in /etc/make.conf itself.  It's typically used
for creating new build images.
.TP
\fBMAINTAINER\fR = \fI[yes|no]\fR
If you have and developer cvs access at cvs.gentoo.org
and \fIMAINTAINER\fR is set to \fI"yes"\fR, the md5 checksum files
for the sources will be automatically added to the cvs tree.
This also tweaks various other Portage settings to be more
maintainer-friendly/appropriate.
.TP
\fBPROXY HTTP_PROXY FTP_PROXY\fR = \fI[host:port]\fR
These vars are used if the sources must be downloaded from the
internet by \fIwget(1)\fR. They are only required if you use a proxy server
for internet access. Eighter define \fIPROXY\fR or
\fIPROXY_FTP\fR and \fIPROXY_HTTP\fR
.TP
\fBGENTOO_MIRRORS\fR = \fI[url]\fR
Insert your nearest \fIIBIBLIO\fR mirror here. This location is tried for
source download before the ones listed in the \fIebuild scripts\fR.
.TP
\fBCHOST\fR
This variable gets passed by the \fIebuild scripts\fR to the \fIconfigure\fR
step as \fI--host=${CHOST}\fR. So you can force the build-host with that.
.TP
\fBMAKEOPTS\fR
Use this variable if you want to use parallel make.  For example, if you
have a dual-processor system, set this variable to "-j2" or "-j3" for 
enhanced build performance with many packages.
.TP
\fBCFLAGS CXXFLAGS\fR 
Use these variables to set the desired optimization/CPU instruction settings
for applications that you compile.  Nearly all ebuild files will take advantage
of your custom settings, resulting in a Gentoo Linux that is fully customized
to your specifications.
.TP
\fBDEBUG\fR
If defined binaries and libraries don't get stripped before \fImerge\fR
.TP
\fBUSE\fR
This variable contains options that controll the build behaviour of
several packages.  More information in ebuild(5).
\fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR
This variable contains the command used for fetching package-sources from
the internet. 
.TP
\fBPORTAGE_TMPDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of the temporary build directories. 
.TP
\fBBUILD_PREFIX\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of the package working directory. 
.TP
\fBPKG_TMPDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
\fIemerge\fR uses this dir to extract a .tbz2 package before the
files get merged to the live filesystem.
.TP
\fBPORTDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of your Portage tree. Defaults to /usr/portage. 
.TP
\fBDISTDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of your local source file repository.  Defaults
to /usr/portage/distfiles.
.TP
\fBPKGDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location where created .tbz2 binary packages will be stored.
Defaults to /usr/portage/packages.
.TP
\fBRPMDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location where created RPM packages will be stored.
