.TH "MAKE.CONF" "5" "Feb 2003" "Portage 2.0.47" "portage"
.SH "NAME"
make.conf \- custom settings for Portage
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B /etc/make.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This file contains various variables that are used by Portage.
Portage will check the currently\-defined environment variables
first for any settings.  If no environment settings are found,
Portage then checks /etc/make.conf.  If no setting is found
in /etc/make.conf, Portage checks /etc/make.globals. If no
setting is found there, the profile's default setting is grabbed
from /etc/make.profile/make.defaults. Please note that all user
settings should be made in the environment or in /etc/make.conf,
which is intended to be customized by the user.
.BR 
Exceptions are incremental variables such as USE, CONFIG_PROTECT*,
and ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.  Incremental variables are propagated down from
make.defaults to make.globals to make.conf to the environment
settings.  Clearing these variables requires a clear\-all as in:
export USE="\-*"
.SH "VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBACCEPT_KEYWORDS\fR = \fI[space delimited list of KEYWORDS]\fR
Enable testing of ebuilds that have not yet been deemed 'stable'.  Users
of the 'x86' architecture would set this to '~x86' while ppc users would
set this to '~ppc'. This is an incremental variable. Only define a ~arch.
.br
Defaults to the value of $ARCH.
.TP
\fBAUTOCLEAN\fR = \fI["yes" | "no"]\fR
Automatically cleans the system by removing outdated packages which will not
remove functionalities or prevent your system from working. On major ABI
changes this may need to be set to off to ensure that the system can be
rebuilt using the new libs before the old ones are removed. Downgrading with
this option turned off may result in missing symlinks and an inoperable system.
.br
Defaults to yes.
.TP
\fBBUILD_PREFIX\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of the package working directory. 
.br
Defaults to ${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage
.TP
\fBCBUILD\fR
This variable is passed by the \fIebuild scripts\fR to the \fIconfigure\fR
as \fI\-\-build=${CBUILD}\fR only if it is defined. Presently HPPA is the
only arch to require this.
.TP
\fBCCACHE_SIZE\fR = \fI"size"\fR
This controls the space use limitations for ccache.  The default is 2 gigabytes 
('2G').  Sizes are specified with 'G', 'M', or 'K'.
.TP
\fBCFLAGS CXXFLAGS\fR 
Use these variables to set the desired optimization/CPU instruction settings
for applications that you compile.  Nearly all ebuild files will take advantage
of your custom settings, resulting in a Gentoo Linux that is fully customized
to your specifications.  Please use sane settings as some packages will fail to
compile/run if the optimizations are too extreme.

.TP
\fBCHOST\fR
This variable is passed by the \fIebuild scripts\fR to the \fIconfigure\fR
step as \fI\-\-host=${CHOST}\fR.  This way you can force the build\-host.

Causes portage to automatically try to add files to cvs that will have to be added 
later.  Done at generation times and only works when \fIcvs\fR is also in 
\fBFEATURES\fR.
.B buildpkg
Binary packages will be created for all packages that are merged.
.TP
.B ccache
Enable portage support for the ccache package.  If the ccache dir is not 
present in the user's environment, then portage will default to 
${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/ccache (with \fIuserpriv\fR) and to /root/.ccache otherwise.
.TP

when creating digests.
.TP
.B digest
Autogenerate a digest for packages.
.TP
.B distcc
Enable portage support for the distcc package.
.TP
.B fixpackages

run whenever packages are moved around in the portage tree.  Please note that this 
can take a lot of time.
.TP
.B keeptemp
Do not delete the ${T} directory after the merge process.
.TP
.B keepwork
Do not delete the ${WORKDIR} directory after the merge process.
.TP
.B mirror

the file already exists in \fBDISTDIR\fR.
.TP
.B noauto
When utilizing \fBebuild\fR(1), only run the function requested.
.TP
.B noclean
Do not delete the the source and temporary files after the merge process.
.TP
.B nostrip
Prevents the stripping of binaries that are merged to the live filesystem.
.TP
.B notitles
Disables xterm titlebar updates (which contains status info).
.TP
.B sandbox
Enable sandbox-ing when running \fBemerge\fR(1) and \fBebuild(1)\fR.
.TP
.B strict
Have portage react strongly to conditions that have the potential to be 
dangerous (like missing or incorrect Manifests).
.TP
.B userpriv
Allow portage to drop root privledges and compile packages as 
portage:portage without a sandbox (unless \fIusersandbox\fR is also used).
.TP
.B usersandbox
Enable the sandbox in the compile phase, when running without root privs (\fIuserpriv\fR).
.RE
.TP
\fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR
This variable contains the command used for fetching package\-sources from
the internet.
.TP
\fBGENTOO_MIRRORS\fR = \fI[URLs]\fR
Insert your space-seperated list of local mirrors here.  These
locations are used to download files before the ones listed in
the \fIebuild scripts\fR. Merging 'mirrorselect' can help.
.TP
\fBHTTP_PROXY FTP_PROXY\fR = \fI[host:port]\fR
These vars are used if the sources must be downloaded from the
internet by \fBwget\fR(1).  They are only required if you use a
proxy server for internet access.  Either define \fIPROXY\fR or
\fIPROXY_FTP\fR and \fIPROXY_HTTP\fR.
.TP
\fBMAKEOPTS\fR
Use this variable if you want to use parallel make.  For example, if you
have a dual\-processor system, set this variable to "\-j2" or "\-j3" for 
enhanced build performance with many packages. Suggested settings are
between \fICPUs+1\fR and \fI2*CPUs+1\fR.
For more information, see \fBmake\fR(1).
.TP
\fBNOCOLOR\fR = \fI["true" | "false"]\fR
Defines if color should be disabled by default.
.br
Defaults to false.
.TP
\fBPKG_TMPDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
\fIemerge\fR uses this dir to extract a .tbz2 package before the
files get merged to the live filesystem.

Defines the location where created .tbz2 binary packages will be stored.
.br
Defaults to ${PORTDIR}/packages.
.TP
.B PORT_LOGDIR

Logs are created only when this is set and writable.
.TP
\fBPORTAGE_BINHOST\fR = \fI"ftp://login:pass@grp.mirror.site/pub/grp/i686/athlon-xp/"\fR
This is the host from which portage will grab prebuilt-binary packages.  
The list is a single entry specifying the full address of the directory 
serving the tbz2's for your system.  This is only used when running with 
the get binary pkg options are given to \fBemerge\fR.  Review \fBemerge\fR(1) 
for more information.  Note that it should point to the 'All' directory on 
the host that creates the binary packages and not to the root of the \fBPKGDIR\fR.
.TP
\fBPORTAGE_NICENESS\fR = \fI[number]\fR
The value of this variable will be added to the current nice level that 
emerge is running at.  In other words, this will not set the nice level, 
it will increment it.  For more information about nice levels and what 
are acceptable ranges, see \fBnice\fR(1).
.TP
\fBPORTAGE_TMPDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of the temporary build directories.
.br
Defaults to /var/tmp.
.TP
\fBPORTDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR

Defaults to no value.
.TP
\fBRESUMECOMMAND\fR
This variable contains the command used for resuming package\-sources that
have been partially downloaded by the \fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR.
.TP
\fBROOT\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Use \fBROOT\fR to specify the target root filesystem to be used for
merging packages or ebuilds.  Typically, you should set this setting
in the environment rather than in /etc/make.conf itself.  It's
typically used for creating new build images.
.br
Defaults to /.
.TP
\fBRSYNC_EXCLUDEFROM\fR = \fI"/etc/portage/rsync_excludes"\fR
This is a file that portage will pass to rsync when it updates the portage tree.  
Specific chucks of the tree may be excluded from the sync process.  This may cause 
dependency failures if you are not careful.  The file format is pattern per line, 
blanks and ';' or '#' lines are comments.  See \fBrsync\fR(1) for more details.
.TP
\fBRSYNC_RETRIES\fR = \fI[NUMBER]\fR
The number of times rsync should retry on failed connections before
giving up.
.br
Defaults to 3.
.TP
\fBRSYNC_TIMEOUT\fR = \fI[SECONDS]\fR

are used to sync the local portage tree when `emerge rsync` is run.
.TP
\fBUSE\fR = \fI[space delimited list of USE items]\fR
This variable contains options that control the build behavior of several
packages.  More information in \fBebuild\fR(5).  Possible USE values
can be found in \fI/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc\fR.
.TP
\fBUSE_ORDER\fR = \fI"env:conf:auto:defaults"\fR
Determines precedence for incrementing the setting of the USE variable.
The above setting will cause the environment (env) to override make.conf
(conf) to override auto generated values from merged packages (auto) to
override make.defaults (defaults).
.br
\fB***warning***\fR
.br
Do not modify this value unless you're a developer and you know what
you're doing. If you change this and something breaks, we will not help
you fix it.
.br
Defaults to "env:conf:auto:defaults".
