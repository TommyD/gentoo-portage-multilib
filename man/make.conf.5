.TH "MAKE.CONF" "5" "October 24, 2002" "Portage 2.0.42" "portage"
.SH "NAME"
make.conf \- custom settings for Portage
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B /etc/make.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This file contains various variables that are used by Portage.
Portage will check the currently\-defined environment variables
first for any settings.  If no environment settings are found,
Portage then checks /etc/make.conf.  If no setting is found
in /etc/make.conf, Portage checks /etc/make.profile/make.defaults.
If no setting is found there, the default setting is grabbed
from /etc/make.globals.  Please note that all user settings
should be made in the environment or in /etc/make.conf, which
is intended to be customized by the user.
.BR 
Exceptions are incremental variables such as USE, CONFIG_PROTECT*,
and ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.  Incremental variables are propagated down from
make.defaults to make.globals to make.conf to the environment
settings.  Clearing these variables requires a clear\-all as in:
export USE="\-*"
.SH "VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBROOT\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Use \fBROOT\fR to specify the target root filesystem to be used for
merging packages or ebuilds.  Typically, you should set this setting
in the environment rather than in /etc/make.conf itself.  It's
typically used for creating new build images.
.br
Defaults to /.
.TP
\fBFEATURES\fR = \fI"buildpkg ccache cvs digest mirror noauto noclean sandbox"\fR
Defines actions portage takes by default.  These options should
not be changed by anyone but developers and/or maintainers.
'sandbox' is an important part of features and should not be
disabled by default.
.TP 
\fBNOCOLOR\fR = \fI["true" | "false"]\fR
Defines if color should be disabled by default.
.br
Defaults to false.
.TP
\fBPROXY HTTP_PROXY FTP_PROXY\fR = \fI[host:port]\fR
These vars are used if the sources must be downloaded from the
internet by \fBwget\fR(1).  They are only required if you use a proxy server
for internet access.  Either define \fIPROXY\fR or
\fIPROXY_FTP\fR and \fIPROXY_HTTP\fR
.TP 
\fBGENTOO_MIRRORS\fR = \fI[URLs]\fR
Insert your list of local mirrors here.  These locations are used to
download files before the ones listed in the \fIebuild scripts\fR.
.TP
\fBCHOST\fR
This variable is passed by the \fIebuild scripts\fR to the \fIconfigure\fR
step as \fI\-\-host=${CHOST}\fR.  This way you can force the build\-host.
.TP
\fBMAKEOPTS\fR
Use this variable if you want to use parallel make.  For example, if you
have a dual\-processor system, set this variable to "\-j2" or "\-j3" for 
enhanced build performance with many packages.  Suggested setting is #CPUs+1.
.TP
\fBCFLAGS CXXFLAGS\fR 
Use these variables to set the desired optimization/CPU instruction settings
for applications that you compile.  Nearly all ebuild files will take advantage
of your custom settings, resulting in a Gentoo Linux that is fully customized
to your specifications.  Please use sane settings as some packages will fail to
compile/run if the optimizations are too extreme.

.TP
\fBDEBUGBUILD\fR
If this is defined, binaries and libraries are not stripped before \fImerge\fR.
.TP
\fBUSE\fR
This variable contains options that control the build behaviour of
several packages.  More information in \fBebuild\fR(5).  Possible USE values
can be found in \fI/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc\fR.
.TP
\fBFETCHCOMMAND\fR
This variable contains the command used for fetching package\-sources from
the internet. 
.TP 
\fBPORTAGE_TMPDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of the temporary build directories.
.br
Defaults to /var/tmp.
.TP
\fBBUILD_PREFIX\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of the package working directory. 
.TP
\fBPKG_TMPDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
\fIemerge\fR uses this dir to extract a .tbz2 package before the
files get merged to the live filesystem.
.TP 
\fBPORTDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of your Portage tree.
.br
Defaults to /usr/portage. 
.TP
\fBPORTDIR_OVERLAY\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines a directory in which user made ebuilds may be stored and not
overwrite when emerge rsync is run.
.br
Defaults to no value.
.TP
\fBDISTDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location of your local source file repository.
.br
Defaults to /usr/portage/distfiles.
.TP
\fBPKGDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location where created .tbz2 binary packages will be stored.
.br
Defaults to /usr/portage/packages.
.TP
\fBRPMDIR\fR = \fI[path]\fR
Defines the location where created RPM packages will be stored.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR ebuild (1),
.BR ebuild (5)
.TP
The \fI/usr/sbin/ebuild.sh\fR script. 
.TP
The helper apps in \fI/usr/lib/portage/bin\fR.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB/etc/make.conf\fR 
Contains variables for the build\-process and overwrites those in make.defaults.
.TP
\fB/etc/make.globals\fR 
Contains the default variables for the build\-process, you should edit \fI/etc/make.conf\fR instead.
.TP
\fB/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc\fR
Contains an extensive list of all possible USE variables.
