.SH "NAME"
ebuild \- the internal format, variables and functions in an ebuild script
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.BR ebuild (1) 
program accepts a single ebuild script as an argument.  This script contains variables and commands that specify how to download, unpack, patch, compile, install and merge a particular software package from its original sources.  In addition to all this, the ebuild script can also contain pre/post install/remove commands, as required.


.SH "EXAMPLES"
Here's a simple example ebuild script, :

.PP 
.SH "VARIABLES"
.TP 
\fBP\fR
This variable contains the package name without the ebuild revision. This variable should NEVER be modified.
.BR  'xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild' $P=='xfree\-4.2.1'
.TP 
\fBPN\fR
Contains the name of the script without the version number.
.BR  'xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild' $PN=='xfree'
.TP 
\fBPV\fR
Contains the verion number without the revision.
.BR  'xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild' $PV=='4.2.1'
.TP 
\fBPR\fR
Contains the revision number or 'r0' if no revision number exists.
.BR  'xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild' $PV=='r2'
.TP 
\fBPF\fR
Contains the full package name \fI[PN]\-[PV]_r[PR]\fR
.BR  'xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild' $P=='xfree\-4.2.1\-r2'
.TP 
\fBA\fR
Contains all source files required for the package. This variable must no
longer be defined because it gets autogenerated from the \fISRC_URI\fR
variables.
.TP 
\fBWORKDIR\fR
Contains the path to the package build root. 
(/var/tmp/portage/[category]/$PF/work). \fIsrc_unpack\fR gets
executed with \fIWORKDIR\fR as the current directory.
.TP 
\fBS\fR
Contains the path to the temporary \fIbuild directory\fR. This variable is used by the functions \fIsrc_compile\fR and \fIsrc_install\fR. Both gets executed
with \fIS\fR as the current directory. This variable can be modified to match the extraction directory of a tarball for the package.
.TP 
\fBD\fR
Contains the path to the temporary \fIinstall directory\fR. (/var/tmp/portage/[category]/$PF/image) ${D} should prefix every write operation that does not involve the helper tools and functions. Do not modify this variable.
.TP 
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
Should contain a short description of the package.
.TP 
\fBSRC_URI\fR
Contains a list of URI's for the required source files. It can contain
multiple URI's for a single source file. The fastest location is choosen
if the file was not found at \fIGENTOO_MIRROR\fB
.TP 
\fBHOMEPAGE\fR
Should contain a list of URL's for the sources main sites and other further
package dependend information.
.TP 
\fBKEYWORDS\fR
Should contain appropriate list of arches that build is know to work/not work. By default if you do not know if a build runs under a particular arch simply omit that KEYWORD.  If the build will not work on that arch include it as \-ppc for example. If the ebuild is being submitted for inclusion, it must have ~arch set for architectures where it has been PROVEN TO WORK. (Packages KEYWORDed this way may be unmasked for testing by setting ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch" on the command line, or in make.conf)
.TP 
\fBSLOT\fR
This sets the SLOT for pacakges that may need to co\-exist.  By default you should set SLOT="0" unless you know what you are doing and need to do otherwise.
.TP 
\fBLICENSE\fR
This should be a space delimited list of licenses that the package falls
under.  This _must_ be set for a matching license in /usr/portage/licenses/.  
If the license does not exist in portage yet you must add it first.
.TP 
\fBIUSE\fR
This should be a list of any and all USE falgs that are leveraged within your 
build script.  The only USE flags that should not get listed here are arch 
related flags (currently x86 ppc sparc sparc64 alpha).
.TP 
\fBDEPEND\fR
This should conatin a list of all packages that are required for the program to compile.
.TP 
\fBRDEPEND\fR
This should contain a list of all packages that are required for this program to run aka runtime depend). If this is not set, then it defaults to the value of DEPEND.
.TP 
.PP 
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.TP 
\fBpkg_setup\fR
This function can be used if the package needs specific setup actions or checks to be preformed before anything else.
.TP 
\fBsrc_unpack\fR
This function is used to unpack all the sources in \fIA\fR to \fIWORKDIR\fR. If not defined in the \fIebuild script\fR it calls \fIunpack ${A}\fR. Any patches and other pre configure/compile modifications should be done here.
.TP 
\fBsrc_compile\fR
All necessary steps for configuration and compilation should be done in here.
.TP 
\fBsrc_install\fR
Should contain everything required to install the package in the temporary \fIinstall directory\fR.
.TP 
\fBpkg_preinst pkg_postinst\fR
All modifications required on the live\-filesystem before and after the package gets merged sould be in here. Also commentary for the user should be listed here as it will be displayed last.
.TP 
\fBpkg_prerm pkg_postrm\fR
Like the *inst functions but for unmerge.
.TP 
\fBconfig\fR
This function should contain optional basic configuration steps.
